              <span>To achieve the goal of becoming a true leader in interdisciplinary teaching and research, the workplace requires more balance in the design and revision of joint appointments for humanities faculty for to the success of professional programs and ultimately, to achieve the goal of providing integrative liberal education and research.   these joint appointments to the best of my knowledge fail to calculate the additional burden of: preparing two annual reviews, having two chairs, 2 deans, working at two different distant campuses; working with different academic schedules (9 month x 11 month); adapting to two different academic cultures. nothing here is the norm for the single department faculty.  the onboarding of joint faculty should be rigorously balanced not to overwhelm and the faculty should be protected and provided special joint mentoring at the university level.   those joint faculty that accept directorships should be offered at least one course release to rebalance the time used for this role, which requires multiple meetings and faculty development. preferably, some compensation for the role should be added as well. the phenomenon of someone being a 40% director due to college appointment distribution is an artifact - it is a continuous job and position.    effective mentoring might be done by panels of joint appointed faculty mentors and follow-ups. many mentors, while offering support, are not jointly appointed themselves, which limits their perspective. mentoring should also include administration, for supporting directorship development for assistant professors.  the tenure evaluation of joint appointed faculty needs revision with more attention for preparation and streamlining.   not least, joint appointments should equitably reflect the pay scale of the work distribution between colleges. the joint appointed faculty is counted for accreditation purposes and provides the linchpin contribution for curriculum development in the professional program. other universities, for comparison sake, use proportional pay scales for joint appointments, meaning that equal work and comparable job preparation (phds, etc) are compensated equitably in the professional program with other single appointed faculty.</span>

              <span>I don&#39;t know about the &#34;number one&#34; thing. but one thing that comes immediately to mind is that we need the institution needs to develop more clarity around faculty governance. in a case in which i was on a search committee, it was clear that a department faculty preferred an external candidate but the dean did not.  so, the dean (as the hiring official) made the offer to the internal candidate. this occurs because the hiring official has decision-making power rather than a voting body. but it&#39;s evidence of the kind of nominal involvement faculty feel like they have in this process and others -- the faculty were involved in the everyday labor of the search: reviewing applications, interviewing candidates, conducting the campus visit, but ultimately the decision was in the hands of the dean who seemed to have made up their mind in advance. internal hires seem more prevalent here than anywhere else i&#39;ve worked, and i&#39;m not always sure that external candidates are actually considered for open positions. we have had several searches (faculty and administrative) in which internal candidates are hired and our college continues to hire graduates from it&#39;s own phd program rather than diversifying its faculty with expertise and experience from beyond our institution.</span>

              <span>The climate at [institution] is awful. the word i have used in my 15 years, consistently, about how the [institution] admin treats faculty and staff-- infantilization.  [institution]&#39;s admin, esp. after [number] years of [administrator], is made up, with some important recent hires and exceptions, of people who do not understand academia.  many are locals, [state] educated, never having really worked in other academic settings, and who see the relationship between the admin and the faculty and staff as adversarial.  it is toxic. staff are berated, mistreated. i have had staff cry in my office because higher level admin treat them so badly.  faculty are not trusted, not seen as professionals, not recognized for their hard work. we have no pre-tenure leave—not even one semester to help do the work to earn tenure. i got tenure despite [institution] not because of [institution]. faculty cannot team teach courses.  supervising honors theses and grad student theses/dissertation has no compensation. a course release for every 5 students who completed a thesis would be something.  but no, nothing but a check on a box in the annual evaluation which means nothing. the rationale-- faculty are lazy and trying to take advantage of [institution]. as one [institution] admin told us in a meeting when someone asked why our publications are not receiving any publicity on the website—well that is part of your job, it isn’t newsworthy. i have so many examples.  during my 1st interaction with [administrator], [number] weeks after starting, [s/he] told me i should be grateful [s/he] was honoring my hiring package and did not think i deserved [compensation type]. my [benefit] decision came when i was [experiencing life event] and i couldn’t tell my ma students anything and they knew what was happening.  the [administrator] told me about several meetings to discuss my [benefit].  was i invited to any of them?  no.  instead, the [administrator] told me stories about when [his/her] kids were little, and how hard it was.  my youngest was a toddler when [institution] finally put a maternity leave policy in place.  and for all of us that came before—nothing. when the editor at my [publisher] asked for a subvention to publish my book, the [administrator] would not meet with me. [he/she] told my [administrator] that [he/she] would not pay for my publication; it was my book, i had to pay. the publisher was stunned—no university [administrator] had ever said no before. [institution] lawyers waited so long (nearly 3 months) before renewing a federally funded contract to do collaborative research (that brought in significant funds, provided wonderful opportunities for students, and meant great statewide media coverage), i had to do damage control with the federal agency reps. why tell us to bring in money if [institution] is going to undermine the process? why professionally humiliate us when we try?  what is the incentive? it’s all about a fundamental lack of trust.  [institution] does not view us as capable, smart, hard working, professionals.  it sees us as children it has to punish. the most basic example. i cannot update or download even the most basic items on my laptop.  why?  i might do something inappropriate.  i can’t even install my home printer—i have to have [institution]it do it for me.  i have always said, [institution] needs to shake up it’s middle and upper level admin.  the top is changing, under it, not so much.  we need more real academics—not people who got a degree at [institution] or somewhere nearby so they could work in university admin.  everyone in admin needs to teach.  everyone in [building] should teach lower division and upper division courses in their field.  it is all too clear that no one thinks about the reason we are here.  we are a school.  we are here for the students.  the faculty are the heart of the mission.  [institution] needs to make much clearer that it respects, appreciates and rewards faculty.  not competitive awards—[teaching incentives, research incentives], etc.  but see how hard we work, how much we put into our teaching, and give us more time to do our research.  and pay attention to the academic calendar.  we changed buildings a few years back.  admin scheduled the move for [number of weeks] before classes started. who could think that was a good idea?  i have taught in rooms where the lights won’t turn off, where the equipment is turned so that if you use the computer your back is to the students, and the list goes on.  if everyone had to teach, had to experience what the faculty and students do, from the president on down, i think things would get better.   when a survey of faculty satisfaction occurred several years ago, [institution]’s admin earned super low scores. this, apparently, surprised people in [building[. instead of really addressing any of the issues, the senior admin sent a handful of faculty fellows to a large meeting (at [a center’s] conference) to ask for input.  not administrators, faculty. i spoke with one, who explained they had been given marching orders.  do not return with any reforms that cost money.  no course releases, no pre-tenure leave, no team-taught courses, none of these simple things that would go a long way.  think about that for a moment—[institution] wants students to have high impact experiences.  i provide many (currently i have [number] [degree] student, [number] ma students, and [number[ phd students).  i get zero compensation for this work.  nothing but a box to check on my annual evaluation (and whether i have 1 or 5 it is the same one box).  think about how much good will and productivity would come from a policy that said for every 5 theses supervised a faculty member got a course release? this was the policy at the [other institution].  doesn’t cost any extra money but would make a huge difference in terms of morale. rather than trying to squeeze every drop out of us, how about recognizing how amazing, hardworking, and accomplished the faculty are and implementing solutions that will show us basic, professional courtesy and respect?</span>

              <span>It should be noted that my responses to your survey are based on two major considerations.  first, our department has had an [administrator] for over [number] years (a tenured faculty member/full professor who has worked in the department for [number]+ years). under this person&#39;s leadership, esteemed researchers/faculty members have resigned/retired/left to go to other institutions because of this [administrator’s] authoritative leadership style - which has profoundly impacted the department (negatively) -- particularly faculty in leadership positions (program director positions, etc.).  there is no open communication &#34;permitted&#34; - this is one of many examples.  at any rate, this has resulted in a non-trusting large group of faculty with low morale, etc.  further, a new dean for the college was hired at the same time the [administrator] took over.  faculty rarely hear from the dean (twice that i can recall), and the [administrator] has made it clear that faculty are not &#34;permitted&#34; to reach out to the dean (the [administrator] must be the one to do this).   having said all of this, the university/department (after two failed searches) successfully completed a search (recently) for the [administrator] position - and the new [administrator] is anticipated to start in early [month].  in consultation with other colleagues, it has been agreed that our department will need some time to &#34;heal&#34; from the past two years...we are hopeful that the new [administrator] will understand the situation.</span>

              <span>There are so many things [institution] needs to do to improve our workplace.  1. [institution] needs to determine if we are still striving for preeminent status.  if we are then give faculty the resources and support they need to produce high quality research.  it is not fair to expect high quality research when we are teaching 5 very large courses a year with no gta and no ra.  2. the [school] has base salaries that are below market rate for our discipline.  yet, our dean expects us to teach 5 courses during the year with continuing class size increases and publish a minimum of [1 journal article in top tier journals per year.  we have no ra no gta.  it is incredibly frustrating.  3.  when i was hired i was told by the previous dean that summer teaching of two courses would always be available. this made the pay relatively comparable to other institutions (although i had to work an additional 6 weeks).  our new dean now says that teaching two classes may not be available. thus making my salary below market rate for my discipline.  these miscommunications should not occur because of a change of leadership.  4.  the lack of support to convert classes from face  to face to online overnight due to the pandemic was astonishing.  incredible amounts of time went into the conversion with very limited support from [institution]. this is shameful.  5.  the lack of support for conducting research during the pandemic is also shameful on the part of [institution].  6.  there seems to be an incredible disconnect between [institution]&#39;s overall goals and my dean&#39;s goals.  it is confusing to understand one message from the dean and then to watch the president&#39;s report and hear a different message.  for example, is [institution] trying to grow or not?</span>

[institution] has alienated its top performers by giving them the same participation trophy that those who aren’t as effective (or in some cases outright incompetent) receive.  this is incredibly shortsighted and has begun to cause a measurable decline in faculty output.  there simply is no motivation to excel, so why bother?    while the faculty “union” is largely responsible for this socialist nonsense, the administration is only too willing to agree because it saves them money.  those of us who are consistently outstanding are easing back on the extra effort because there is no discernible benefit to strive for excellence.    the result from this, as with all socialist policies, is ubiquitous mediocrity.</span>

              <span>Focus on the goal of educating the public.  that goal has been largely displaced by a preoccupation with diversity and inclusivity initiatives.  simultaneously, our undergraduate class sizes are vastly larger than they should be.  [institution] is a diploma mill.  academic standards are routinely compromised in the name of diversity, inclusivity, and inattention by course instructors.  this trend ultimately undermines the central role played by institutions of higher learning for the past millennia.  i implore you - reallocate resources from d&amp;i to student training in methods of rationality, improvement of laboratory science training for students from all disciplines, writing-intensive coursework, and reduction of class sizes.  grade inflation further undermines the legitimacy of our work and must be addressed.  maybe, just maybe, if we are genuinely concerned with equitable treatment of persons and equity in undergraduate enrollment, we may devote some attention to addressing the most substantive disparity on campus - the shortage of men in college classrooms.</span>

              <span>Faculty salaries, esp. for non-tenure earning faculty, continue to lag behind peer institutions. the university has a drive to constantly innovate and push forward new initiatives—which leads to both an attractive sense of possibility that gets many faculty excited to work here, but also potential feelings of burnout over time. recognizing via compensation the work teaching-focused faculty do to keep the university moving forward and promote student success would go a long way towards helping nte faculty be successful here. promotion for nte faculty is valuable, but base salaries still lag significantly, especially for faculty who have been here for longer. tying salary increases almost exclusively to competitive processes like [teaching awards] (that reward individual effort) seems to perhaps work against the sort of collaboration the university seeks to promote, especially interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.</span>

              <span>I think the number one thing that my university could do to improve working conditions would be to change the bonus system currently in place. the primary bonus system is called [name] and it is a system that i feel unfairly awards individuals based upon who you&#39;re friends with on the award committee as opposed to actual hard work. it is very difficult in that many department&#39;s are understaffed and as such have classes and teaching loads that are quite larger then in previous years. these teachers are unable to do creative and unique activities because of the number of students they have. however our bonus structure is based on recognizing these activities. when faculty do not have the ability to engage in the same creative aspects that other department&#39;s do with smaller student populations, it fundamentally makes this system unfair.   the second change i would recommend is better treatment for non tenure track faculty. these individuals are known as either lecturers or instructors at our university and are the backbone of teaching students. however administration and leadership at our institution devalue their worth by not allowing them to serve on committees that only tenure track individuals can serve. there is also higher pay for these individuals than non tenure tract faculty. in the past there was a thought of changing the name of these individuals to teaching professors but tenure track faculty fought this very hard because they did not want to share the title of professor with individuals who &#34;just teach&#34; and do not do research. the primary purpose of the university is to educate students. these individuals are the ones who are teaching large class loads and getting in credit hours to enable professors to do research. they are extremely undervalued and there should be an effort to recognize there accomplishments in contributions.</span>

              <span>Graduate students are the foundation of a research university. our administration -- from the [institution] office of student financial assistance, up to and including the president of [institution], have demonstrated an unsettling lack of understanding as to the role of graduate students -- who they are, what they do, and how they contribute to our university&#39;s mission. [institution] has lofty ambitions of expanding its international recognition and prominence as an r1 research institution, and yet our base graduate stipends are several thousand dollars below the estimated poverty line for the [regional] area. particularly worrisome is the treatment (and at times, outright disrespect) towards our graduate students of color -- not necessarily at the individual level, but at the institutional level. for example, the office of student financial assistance routinely fails to distribute external funding to our graduate students in a timely manner. in one particularly egregious incident, i understand that a phd student of color was instructed to take out personal loans to make ends meet until his external fellowship -- which was awarded to promote diverse representation in stem -- came through. in fact the funds had already been transferred to [institution], and there was no legitimate excuse for the delay. nevertheless, the student was told that nothing could be done, and the student became visibly upset (and justifiably so). in response, rather than attempting to look into the issue to help the student, this graduate student of color was threatened with removal by security. a few hours later, a white male colleague in my department made a phone call to a white male administrator, and the funds were released to the student on the very same day. i share this anecdote because this shameful incident is a consistent pattern with [institution] -- performative dialogue regarding both 1) research excellence and 2) diversity and inclusion, while our very own students too often fall between the cracks. i also share this because i know we can do better. i am happy to acknowledge [institution]&#39;s attempts at progress over the last year, but there is a very long way to go before [institution] is truly an inclusive environment. expanding resources for graduate students -- most importantly, raising the base stipend to *at least* a living wage -- would be substantially more effective at improving our recruitment/retention abilities for both graduate students and faculty, and would simultaneously make [institution] a more hospitable environment for our students of color. to conclude, it is my view that the single greatest threat to [institution]&#39;s continued success is its lack of investment in graduate students. while it is certainly not too late to address the issue, we are moving too slowly, and risk being left in the dust by our peer institutions.</span>

              <span>[institution] is an excellent place to work for its fairness, clarity, and non-discrimination environment. the salary and other benefits are acceptable. however, as a lecturer, i have the following severe issues:  - teacher and student ratio is insane when taking 4+3 courses in two semesters. it turns out that in a semester a teacher might need to deal with 800 to 1000 students. also, if a course has labs, it can become 32 different sections to manage by the teacher in a particular semester. thanks to [institution] for providing grading and ta supports, however, the teacher also needs to manage this large group for proper task assignment, monitoring, rubric preparation, etc. the number of loads makes it difficult for me to balance my life and health, some semesters i lost weight a lot to deal with the semester&#39;s loads.  as a lecturer, 4+3 is perfectly fine for me if the teacher to student ratio is decreased significantly. more students mean more issues and a lot more emails and overall lot more things to manage. also, it becomes difficult to give good feedback to students, difficult to understand the class status and individual student&#39;s status, and at the end, it might badly affect the student&#39;s performance as well as student evaluation to the teacher.   [institution] and especially my department should strongly consider this issue which significantly affects the life of the lecturers.  my strong suggestion would be to reduce the teacher/student ratio. maybe when the number of students in a course is more than 100 or other thresholds, then count every 100 students as a single course in the teaching load count.  also, if a course has a lab, it should be also considered in the teaching load assignment with some different policy. otherwise, it will be unfair to the teacher who is teaching courses with labs compared to the teacher who does not have labs.  for example, teacher1 is taking 4 courses without any labs and he has total of 4x80 = 320 students. on the other hand, teacher2 is taking 4 courses with all labs. he has total 4 x 250 = 1000 students with 32 sections including labs. this type of distribution is completely unfair. for teacher2, the number of courses must be decreased to make it relatively fair.  - the differences between the salaries of the non-tenure track faculty (lecturer) and tenure track faculty are extremely high. it is understandable they have a research load, however, they have also a very low teaching load.  the salary differences look very unfair.  - with such a teaching load with so many students to a lecturer, the salary needs to be significantly increased. a faculty can earn the same amount with a significantly low student load in another place. so, it should be considered to retain the faculty. i know my friends who are assistant professors/lecturers at other universities. they have low research pressure, and also a small teaching load with only a few students per class. they are earning much more than me. overall, people in other places might have a similar course load like us, but with a very small class size. however, they earn more than us which is very discouraging. i hope [institution] will consider this pressure on the teachers and adjust salary accordingly.  thanks for the opportunity to express my thought.</span>

              <span>I have one general suggestion and one specific suggestion. the general one is to cut down on red tape. one of the most striking aspects of coming to [institution] was the amount of red tape and bureaucracy. nothing seems to be easy – everything seems to take more time and energy than is needed. the influence of risk management seems to be quite high in the university – avoiding legal issues seems to be the primary explanation for all of the extra rules and paperwork. although i understand the need to minimize risk and to ensure ethical behavior, that emphasis can also become highly burdensome to the point that it decreases the productivity of the faculty. there has to be a reasonable balance. i would love for our leadership to actively seek out where there is unnecessary red tape and do what it can to minimize it – doing so may be one of the most impactful steps that could be taken to increase the productivity of the university faculty. this is especially true in the office of research. a great example is when an opportunity comes to bring in a small external contract. i have heard over and over again, and have experienced personally, all the barriers that are put into place when an outside company or institution wants to pay our faculty and/or students to do an applied project for them. whether it’s due to [institution]’s unreasonable stance on the overhead/indirect rates or the amount of paperwork involved or the length of time it takes to get approved, i have seen or heard of many opportunities that are lost because [institution] simply makes it too hard to bring in this money. this seems inconsistent with the university calling itself the partnership university. this is just one example. the university leadership should actively solicit feedback from faculty on an ongoing basis on what systems or processes are unnecessarily burdensome or difficult, and then take necessary and reasonable steps to fix these issues.   my second suggestion is much more specific. i would love it if the university could figure out a way to efficiently get small pots of money (i.e., less than $5k) to faculty to support their research. i bring in a good amount of external grant money, but those funds are earmarked for very specific purposes. there are internal mechanisms to get research support, but they tend to be larger and/or create a lot of work for everyone (long applications, committees to review the applications, etc.). it would be great if the university could figure out a more efficient way to support faculty research in small ways, especially faculty who have shown that they are highly productive and bring in grant funds to the university. one possibility would be to have a simple automatic way for faculty to get a small seed grant (maybe $3000-5000) every few years. there could be some basic criteria and mechanisms to spread the funds around, hopefully without creating more bureaucracy (e.g., committees that have to review applications, etc.). however, an even easier course of action would be to increase the amount of money from indirects that goes back to the faculty, because right now it is fairly paltry. maybe it could be some sort of match from the university up to a certain amount. by doing this, faculty who have already proven that they can bring in research funds get rewarded, and the funds go to those who are the most likely to put the funds to use to bring in more funds that would benefit the university. the same could be said for buying out – the university benefits greatly when faculty use grant funds to buy out of teaching, and yet there is actually little additional incentive to do so beyond the reduced teaching load. again, by incentivizing this type of behavior (e.g., by adding a percentage of the buyout funds to the faculty’s research account), the university would be rewarding behavior that benefits it and puts more funds into the hands of faculty who are most likely to use it in beneficial ways in the future.</span>

[institution] also needs to make it an active priority to make faculty (in particular) more than representative racially and ethnically, and to provide ongoing support for faculty of color. i keep seeing coache surveys that say the same things (bipoc faculty and staff do not have good experiences on campus, etc.), but no changes are implemented. there are also problems with the coache survey (and other surveys) that make it nearly impossible to gather complete information about the experiences of bipoc faculty and staff. the university could further do more to make the student body representative. for example, there are far fewer black students than there are black people in [state].</span>

[institution] is better than some other institutions when it comes to this, but there is still what i feel an &#34;outdated&#34; view of nte faculty. for example, we are the only group to be classified by &#34;what we are not.&#34; i believe there is great value in teaching, and there is also research done on teaching and learning. recognizing this value as equal to someone pulling in grants and other research i think would be a great step in the right direction.</span>
