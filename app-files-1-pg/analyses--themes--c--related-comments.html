            <li><span class="comments">To achieve the goal of becoming a true leader in interdisciplinary teaching and research, the workplace requires more balance in the design and revision of joint appointments for humanities faculty for to the success of professional programs and ultimately, to achieve the goal of providing integrative liberal education and research.   These joint appointments to the best of my knowledge fail to calculate the additional burden of: preparing two annual reviews, having two chairs, 2 deans, working at two different distant campuses; working with different academic schedules (9 month x 11 month); adapting to two different academic cultures. Nothing here is the norm for the single department faculty.  The onboarding of joint faculty should be rigorously balanced not to overwhelm and the faculty should be protected and provided special joint mentoring at the university level.   Those joint faculty that accept directorships should be offered at least one course release to rebalance the time used for this role, which requires multiple meetings and faculty development. Preferably, some compensation for the role should be added as well. The phenomenon of someone being a 40% director due to college appointment distribution is an artifact - it is a continuous job and position.    Effective mentoring might be done by panels of joint appointed faculty mentors and follow-ups. Many mentors, while offering support, are not jointly appointed themselves, which limits their perspective. Mentoring should also include administration, for supporting directorship development for assistant professors.  The tenure evaluation of joint appointed faculty needs revision with more attention for preparation and streamlining.   Not least, joint appointments should equitably reflect the pay scale of the work distribution between colleges. The joint appointed faculty is counted for accreditation purposes and provides the linchpin contribution for curriculum development in the professional program. Other universities, for comparison sake, use proportional pay scales for joint appointments, meaning that equal work and comparable job preparation (Phds, etc) are compensated equitably in the professional program with other single appointed faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The climate at [institution] is awful. The word I have used in my 15 years, consistently, about how the [institution] admin treats faculty and staff-- infantilization.  [institution]&#39;s admin, esp. after [number] years of [administrator], is made up, with some important recent hires and exceptions, of people who do not understand academia.  Many are locals, [state] educated, never having really worked in other academic settings, and who see the relationship between the admin and the faculty and staff as adversarial.  It is toxic. Staff are berated, mistreated. I have had staff cry in my office because higher level admin treat them so badly.  Faculty are not trusted, not seen as professionals, not recognized for their hard work. We have no pre-tenure leave—not even one semester to help do the work to earn tenure. I got tenure despite [institution] not because of [institution]. Faculty cannot team teach courses.  Supervising Honors theses and grad student theses/dissertation has no compensation. A course release for every 5 students who completed a thesis would be something.  But no, nothing but a check on a box in the annual evaluation which means nothing. The rationale-- faculty are lazy and trying to take advantage of [institution]. As one [institution] admin told us in a meeting when someone asked why our publications are not receiving any publicity on the website—well that is part of your job, it isn’t newsworthy. I have so many examples.  During my 1st interaction with [administrator], [number] weeks after starting, [s/he] told me I should be grateful [s/he] was honoring my hiring package and did not think I deserved [compensation type]. My [benefit] decision came when I was [experiencing life event] and I couldn’t tell my MA students anything and they knew what was happening.  The [administrator] told me about several meetings to discuss my [benefit].  Was I invited to any of them?  No.  Instead, the [administrator] told me stories about when [his/her] kids were little, and how hard it was.  My youngest was a toddler when [institution] finally put a maternity leave policy in place.  And for all of us that came before—nothing. When the editor at my [publisher] asked for a subvention to publish my book, the [administrator] would not meet with me. [He/she] told my [administrator] that [he/she] would not pay for my publication; it was my book, I had to pay. The publisher was stunned—no university [administrator] had ever said no before. [Institution] lawyers waited so long (nearly 3 months) before renewing a federally funded contract to do collaborative research (that brought in significant funds, provided wonderful opportunities for students, and meant great statewide media coverage), I had to do damage control with the federal agency reps. Why tell us to bring in money if [institution] is going to undermine the process? Why professionally humiliate us when we try?  What is the incentive? It’s all about a fundamental lack of trust.  [institution] does not view us as capable, smart, hard working, professionals.  It sees us as children it has to punish. The most basic example. I cannot update or download even the most basic items on my laptop.  Why?  I might do something inappropriate.  I can’t even install my home printer—I have to have [institution]IT do it for me.  I have always said, [institution] needs to shake up it’s middle and upper level admin.  The top is changing, under it, not so much.  We need more real academics—not people who got a degree at [institution] or somewhere nearby so they could work in university admin.  Everyone in admin needs to teach.  Everyone in [building] should teach lower division and upper division courses in their field.  It is all too clear that no one thinks about the reason we are here.  We are a school.  We are here for the students.  The faculty are the heart of the mission.  [institution] needs to make much clearer that it respects, appreciates and rewards faculty.  Not competitive awards—[teaching incentives, research incentives], etc.  But see how hard we work, how much we put into our teaching, and give us more time to do our research.  And pay attention to the academic calendar.  We changed buildings a few years back.  Admin scheduled the move for [number of weeks] before classes started. Who could think that was a good idea?  I have taught in rooms where the lights won’t turn off, where the equipment is turned so that if you use the computer your back is to the students, and the list goes on.  If everyone had to teach, had to experience what the faculty and students do, from the President on down, I think things would get better.   When a survey of faculty satisfaction occurred several years ago, [institution]’s admin earned super low scores. This, apparently, surprised people in [building[. Instead of really addressing any of the issues, the senior admin sent a handful of faculty fellows to a large meeting (at [a center’s] conference) to ask for input.  Not administrators, faculty. I spoke with one, who explained they had been given marching orders.  Do not return with any reforms that cost money.  No course releases, no pre-tenure leave, no team-taught courses, none of these simple things that would go a long way.  Think about that for a moment—[institution] wants students to have high impact experiences.  I provide many (currently I have [number] [degree] student, [number] MA students, and [number[ PhD students).  I get zero compensation for this work.  Nothing but a box to check on my annual evaluation (and whether I have 1 or 5 it is the same one box).  Think about how much good will and productivity would come from a policy that said for every 5 theses supervised a faculty member got a course release? This was the policy at the [other institution].  Doesn’t cost any extra money but would make a huge difference in terms of morale. Rather than trying to squeeze every drop out of us, how about recognizing how amazing, hardworking, and accomplished the faculty are and implementing solutions that will show us basic, professional courtesy and respect?</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Greater faculty support. Listening to faculty. Coaching and facilitating us. Asking us our career goals and actively reaching out to help us achieve them. Less top down busy work. Less mistrust and contempt of faculty by administrators. Increased respect for faculty&#39;s voice. Acting like we matter to the institution. Recognizing our work. Seeking to build us up, instead of always making us feel we aren&#39;t doing enough. We haven&#39;t gotten any real recognition of all the work we had to do to help students during COVID. No one cares about our mental health, work load, etc. The work just keeps piling on, and yet we are expected to keep producing creative/research works without support or funding. The faculty who hold up the institution with teaching and service are undervalued. Only the faculty who bring in big grant $ seem to get rewarded or recognized.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Deepen opportunities for faculty to research, and produce maximally. Create greater diversity, both in ideas and in campus presence of other populations. Build a greater basis for collegial life; this university is very alienating, and sometimes feels impersonal, because faculty have very scant opportunities to meet, interact, socialize, examine each other&#39;s work, and generally live a collegial life! The University often tends to think of faculty, it seems, as workers and contractors, not as a Deanry of scholars, engaged in high research in a community of knowledge. This in my mind, affects the relationship between work, and the essence of the work done in the university. The university has to offer in sum, an equal acknowledgement of faculty doing work whether in the Humanities or in Science, or in Engineering, or the Social Sciences; and stop creating an academic apartheid of privileges that tend to segregate accomplishments and create dissatisfaction!</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">1) We are incredibly underpaid, it&#39;s insulting.  2) [institution] pays a lot of lip service for things, but is all talk.  There is no real change or programmatic resources allocated to institute change.  Ie, [institution mental health service] is supposed to support students&#39; mental health, but every time I&#39;ve referred a student there they&#39;re told the waiting list is ridiculously long, they can&#39;t get an appointment, etc.  [Institution mental health service] is a public campaign, but no funding to support the substance. Or, [institution] supposedly supports interdisciplinarity, but is so confused about how to recognize or encourage work without siloing it into disciplinary boxes.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Reconfigure the [Interdisciplinary College]. The creation of this college destroyed the work of the College of [Field].</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">create formalized mentorship opportunities for non-tenure track faculty  create formalized but anonymous opportunities for faculty/staff to provide feedback on dept chair work style, leadership style, etc.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Recognize, and compensate for, the almost insurmountable workload we have, especially during these unprecedented times as we&#39;ve all worked essentially double the amount of hours to adapt/teach virtually with other responsibilities, and ensure equitable treatment of, and opportunities, for all faculty. Due to the limited amount of university-wide opportunities for awards, grants, and leadership opportunities, this promotes competition amongst faculty and hinders interdisciplinary collaboration as well as collaboration within departments. High amount of workloads (teaching large enrolled classes, teaching many classes, teaching many nights and 3 days per week, and doing this in additional to expectations for service, professional development, and being high-performing non-tenure earning research faculty for a low amount of pay) already creates additional stress, but opportunities for support are limited and our college most recently eliminated all of our departmental administrative support as well. Create more opportunities for faculty who are NEW (less than 5 years with [institution]) AND non tenure earning to receive support (teaching assistants), recognition, awards, course releases of time to conduct research or engage in fellowships as well as formal mentorship from senior faculty within their department, college, university, and outside of the university if they request it.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Consistent salary increases to match changes in cost of living and the elimination of competitive awards that put faculty against one another</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">The constant push to be #1 or the &#34;best&#34; in all things is like working in an institution that is constantly striving to compete with the better and more recognized older sibling (i.e., [other state universities]). It is a type of self-absorption that is tiring and embarrassing.  First, the university was all about grow, grow, grow.  Now its all about aspiring to some national status.  Either way, faculty expectations are constantly changing and growing more demanding.  The publication norms are ridiculous in my department. It is not possible for a sole person to meet them.  Someone would have to be constantly working with a group of people where the division of labor is so splintered that it is possible to get 3 publications a year. It is not possible for 1 person to do this.  So you are essentially no longer being evaluated based on what you and you alone can do. Everything at this university is a numbers game.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Invest in infrastructure for all research levels, improve research facilities for all faculty members, not just NEW faculty. Current faculty are working in substandard conditions and expected to make great contributions, yet have no opportunity to innovative factilites for research since arrival. Move to new labs, or research centers. We are expected to provide research opportunities for undergraduates but have no space, nor resources to mentor UG or G adequately.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">I would like to see a complete overhaul in the &#34;non-tenure&#34; track faculty approach.  First, that name, &#34;non-tenure&#34; track faculty is borderline disrespectful because it focuses on what we don&#39;t have or what we are not rather than who we are and what we do have. That is tremendous strength often in practice and teaching methodology.  Second, there is not a lot of mentoring directly in our department space for non-tenure track faculty. We receive much of our formal mentorship opportunity through our university faculty and teaching center (thank goodness for them--they are great) and our group of non-tenure track faculty within the department have taken it upon ourselves to meet together periodically so we can talk about our opportunities and challenges. But there is not a formal mentorship process that I have been a part of at the department or even college level.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Allow long distance or at home work/ teaching for faculty, especially those in dual career couples. Allow online office hours, online participation to committee and department meetings, [teaching and learning center] conferences, and other activities. The pandemic has shown we can work, teach, collaborate effectively from home. Especially in situations where faculty have accumulated a [time period] or more of being in long distance dual career couples, our work-life balance suffers tremendously and so does our morale. We have the technology to allow more flexibility in this kind of situations, and accommodate those who, due to family circumstances, show a real need for this kind of accommodation.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">I would very much like to see additional resources and attention devoted to research and scholarship. In my department for the last five years or so, there has been no focus on research, recognizing research, supporting research. It&#39;s just so strange to have research and scholarship be such a vital and generative part of my professional life, but have it be so absent from any discussion or action in my department. From what I gather, my department is mostly focused on getting faculty involved in and supporting their efforts toward various kinds of departmental service. Over the past five years in my department, tenure-line and tenured faculty have never once had an opportunity to come together to talk about the status and value of research/scholarship in the department, or to talk with the department chair about how to support that work.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">I work from a regional campus, however, I notice many of the questions of this survey reflect the attitude of the university: regional campuses are an after-thought. Every time the word &#34;campus&#34; is used, it refers to the Main campus or now (increasingly) the [redacted] campus. This affects everything from the way data is housed and shared (or, in my case, NOT shared) to the ability to collaborate with my peers. Moreover, this sentiment seems to be consistent across many administrators. I would point out the [institution] service area encompasses [&gt;9 state] counties.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Provide more salary-based awards (teaching, research).</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Align the &#34;talking points&#34; and leadership mumbo-jumbo with what actually goes on. [Institution] does a great job of self-promotion, and our college (medicine) is expert at it. But day to day we are running a real mess - the dean is in over her head with a lot of show and little real experience. She will not be able to right the ship and has created serious problems with all of our partnership institutions.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">There are some members of the faculty who do not believe in health disparities or social injustice. Some are vocal and some are silent. However, they are a strong force of change that is restricting many aspects of diversity, equity, and inclusion to create a sense of belonging.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">There needs to be fewer fiefdoms. I have said this over and over. Yet nothing is done. Follow published standards across the board without exception.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Administration has a long history of not being transparent and engaging in shared governance, and that was expected to change in the past year with a new admin, but decisions made with respect to remote work and the pandemic have not seemed in line with that expectation.  Lecturers (non tenure-track lines) receive no mentoring, little support, have no ability to negotiate raises (likelihood of receiving outside offers is next to nil when they are not conducting research actively)</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Mentor associate faculty toward promotion</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Faculty salaries, esp. for non-tenure earning faculty, continue to lag behind peer institutions. The university has a drive to constantly innovate and push forward new initiatives—which leads to both an attractive sense of possibility that gets many faculty excited to work here, but also potential feelings of burnout over time. Recognizing via compensation the work teaching-focused faculty do to keep the university moving forward and promote student success would go a long way towards helping NTE faculty be successful here. Promotion for NTE faculty is valuable, but base salaries still lag significantly, especially for faculty who have been here for longer. Tying salary increases almost exclusively to competitive processes like [teaching awards] (that reward individual effort) seems to perhaps work against the sort of collaboration the university seeks to promote, especially interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">To improve the quality of research, we need to have more focused and collegial group and environment. We are currently lack of a definite development training and system for research junior faculty development. They are facing multiple challenges in particular after Covid-19 pandemic.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Set compensation based on the number of students a faculty member teaches each academic year.  Ensure there is no difference in pay scale between tenured and non-tenured faculty members.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Mentor some faculty to be fair to students and respect others</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Make it clear to tenured faculty not to pile work on tenure track faculty because it &#34;will look good for their tenure package&#34;.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">We need to define an institutional identity: The university relatively recently and rather tenuously qualified to lay claim to being R1, yet it still operates much like a very large community college in style and substance (e.g. a R1 university that does not have 24-hour library access?) What are we, really? What does the university feasibly aspire to be?  In this vein, [institution] needs an integrating vision to align more effectively its many disparate and often duplicating efforts. The silo effect besets modern universities across the globe, yes -- largely due to hyper-specialization in the modern academy -- but I have never elsewhere witnessed so many little pockets and enclaves and silos that simply do not speak to each other, even when they have goals in common or overlapping interests.</span></li>
