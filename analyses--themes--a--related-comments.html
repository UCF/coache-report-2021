COACHE analysts assigned all responses to one or more common themes. The following are responses found to be related to this theme.</span>

    </div><!-- end .head -->

    <div class="body">
      <div class="list">
        <ul>

            <li><span class="comments">Improving equity between titles and compensation between non-TT and TT positions. Far too often, lecturers with terminal degrees are hired who take on [class number] loads and do as much or more research as TT faculty but they are compensated much less. Titles for these positions could be improved to improve equity and standing at the University among faculty (e.g. Asst. Professor of Practice rather than Lecturer as a title).</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Increase staff support for pre-award and post-award</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Parking. Parking is a financial burden. Even during a pandemic - teaching on campus required a parking permit. The majority of faculty did NOT need to purchase the permit, as they were not required to be on campus. Only the few who stayed to teach in person - who were then penalized - by having to purchase parking passes.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">more graduate teaching assistants in our department</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">So many of us having to use Webcourse and Zoom instead of face-to-face classes. And yet, when I call webcourse support it takes 3 days or more before they get back to me (with several times it taking more than a week)! By that time, the unresolved problem has become a huge problem to my students and many are angry with me though I have no control over the situation. This problem has been going on for more than one year. Why didn&#39;t the University just hire more tech people given the greater numbers who would be relying on them the last three months?</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Everything is great!</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I would like to see [institution] place more focus on equity and inclusion practices from the student body up to faculty positions. A serious framework should be developed that elevates underrepresented groups and shows that we are a coherent plan to address inequities across all aspects of our institution.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Give departments resources to allow course reduction for service. The service burden is so high it’s very hard to accomplish things collectively because we are too overtaxed.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The number one thing my institution could do is to create a functional [research office]. All of the duties of an office of research are being pushed down to the department and college level. This puts too much workload on the one college and one department person who work on grants and it creates backlogs, delays, and lack of communication across university offices. [Research office] routinely makes mistakes and then threatens and aggressively blames other units. There is a widespread fear of the [research office]. It is very difficult to run grant-funded research at [institution] because there is so little administrative support. At this point, I&#39;m spending almost equal amounts of time dealing with the administrative side of grants as I am doing the work. It is not sustainable and I imagine that grant-active faculty will look to leave [institution] to go to a place that is better equipped to support funded research.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Review and put in place equitable teaching loads</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Differentiate teaching loads! Teaching loads could be differentiated for various levels of students and based on faculty interest/capability to do research and/or collaborations with graduate students or other faculty</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Pay non-tenure track instructors a wage commensurate to that of  other universities and provide a yearly increase without them having to jump through hoops.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Assign financial support to the things they claim matter, for example diverse hiring and retention as well as growing as a research university.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I don&#39;t know about the &#34;number one&#34; thing. But one thing that comes immediately to mind is that we need the institution needs to develop more clarity around faculty governance. In a case in which I was on a search committee, it was clear that a department faculty preferred an external candidate but the Dean did not.  So, the Dean (as the hiring official) made the offer to the internal candidate. This occurs because the hiring official has decision-making power rather than a voting body. But it&#39;s evidence of the kind of nominal involvement faculty feel like they have in this process and others -- the faculty were involved in the everyday labor of the search: reviewing applications, interviewing candidates, conducting the campus visit, but ultimately the decision was in the hands of the Dean who seemed to have made up their mind in advance. Internal hires seem more prevalent here than anywhere else I&#39;ve worked, and I&#39;m not always sure that external candidates are actually considered for open positions. We have had several searches (faculty and administrative) in which internal candidates are hired and our college continues to hire graduates from it&#39;s own PhD program rather than diversifying its faculty with expertise and experience from beyond our institution.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The climate at [institution] is awful. The word I have used in my 15 years, consistently, about how the [institution] admin treats faculty and staff-- infantilization.  [institution]&#39;s admin, esp. after [number] years of [administrator], is made up, with some important recent hires and exceptions, of people who do not understand academia.  Many are locals, [state] educated, never having really worked in other academic settings, and who see the relationship between the admin and the faculty and staff as adversarial.  It is toxic. Staff are berated, mistreated. I have had staff cry in my office because higher level admin treat them so badly.  Faculty are not trusted, not seen as professionals, not recognized for their hard work. We have no pre-tenure leave—not even one semester to help do the work to earn tenure. I got tenure despite [institution] not because of [institution]. Faculty cannot team teach courses.  Supervising Honors theses and grad student theses/dissertation has no compensation. A course release for every 5 students who completed a thesis would be something.  But no, nothing but a check on a box in the annual evaluation which means nothing. The rationale-- faculty are lazy and trying to take advantage of [institution]. As one [institution] admin told us in a meeting when someone asked why our publications are not receiving any publicity on the website—well that is part of your job, it isn’t newsworthy. I have so many examples.  During my 1st interaction with [administrator], [number] weeks after starting, [s/he] told me I should be grateful [s/he] was honoring my hiring package and did not think I deserved [compensation type]. My [benefit] decision came when I was [experiencing life event] and I couldn’t tell my MA students anything and they knew what was happening.  The [administrator] told me about several meetings to discuss my [benefit].  Was I invited to any of them?  No.  Instead, the [administrator] told me stories about when [his/her] kids were little, and how hard it was.  My youngest was a toddler when [institution] finally put a maternity leave policy in place.  And for all of us that came before—nothing. When the editor at my [publisher] asked for a subvention to publish my book, the [administrator] would not meet with me. [He/she] told my [administrator] that [he/she] would not pay for my publication; it was my book, I had to pay. The publisher was stunned—no university [administrator] had ever said no before. [Institution] lawyers waited so long (nearly 3 months) before renewing a federally funded contract to do collaborative research (that brought in significant funds, provided wonderful opportunities for students, and meant great statewide media coverage), I had to do damage control with the federal agency reps. Why tell us to bring in money if [institution] is going to undermine the process? Why professionally humiliate us when we try?  What is the incentive? It’s all about a fundamental lack of trust.  [institution] does not view us as capable, smart, hard working, professionals.  It sees us as children it has to punish. The most basic example. I cannot update or download even the most basic items on my laptop.  Why?  I might do something inappropriate.  I can’t even install my home printer—I have to have [institution]IT do it for me.  I have always said, [institution] needs to shake up it’s middle and upper level admin.  The top is changing, under it, not so much.  We need more real academics—not people who got a degree at [institution] or somewhere nearby so they could work in university admin.  Everyone in admin needs to teach.  Everyone in [building] should teach lower division and upper division courses in their field.  It is all too clear that no one thinks about the reason we are here.  We are a school.  We are here for the students.  The faculty are the heart of the mission.  [institution] needs to make much clearer that it respects, appreciates and rewards faculty.  Not competitive awards—[teaching incentives, research incentives], etc.  But see how hard we work, how much we put into our teaching, and give us more time to do our research.  And pay attention to the academic calendar.  We changed buildings a few years back.  Admin scheduled the move for [number of weeks] before classes started. Who could think that was a good idea?  I have taught in rooms where the lights won’t turn off, where the equipment is turned so that if you use the computer your back is to the students, and the list goes on.  If everyone had to teach, had to experience what the faculty and students do, from the President on down, I think things would get better.   When a survey of faculty satisfaction occurred several years ago, [institution]’s admin earned super low scores. This, apparently, surprised people in [building[. Instead of really addressing any of the issues, the senior admin sent a handful of faculty fellows to a large meeting (at [a center’s] conference) to ask for input.  Not administrators, faculty. I spoke with one, who explained they had been given marching orders.  Do not return with any reforms that cost money.  No course releases, no pre-tenure leave, no team-taught courses, none of these simple things that would go a long way.  Think about that for a moment—[institution] wants students to have high impact experiences.  I provide many (currently I have [number] [degree] student, [number] MA students, and [number[ PhD students).  I get zero compensation for this work.  Nothing but a box to check on my annual evaluation (and whether I have 1 or 5 it is the same one box).  Think about how much good will and productivity would come from a policy that said for every 5 theses supervised a faculty member got a course release? This was the policy at the [other institution].  Doesn’t cost any extra money but would make a huge difference in terms of morale. Rather than trying to squeeze every drop out of us, how about recognizing how amazing, hardworking, and accomplished the faculty are and implementing solutions that will show us basic, professional courtesy and respect?</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The institution should put the focus back on teaching instead of putting so much pressure on service/research, as this seems to have taken precedence, resulting in teaching efforts to be lower in priority. Recognizing teaching loads and compensating for them in a more balanced fashion would also help faculty remain teaching-centered.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Fix the grant/contract execution process (including legal review -- takes far too long and research is held up unnecessarily by uninformed legal review; invoicing; executing of purchase orders and subcontracts, ...)</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Greater faculty support. Listening to faculty. Coaching and facilitating us. Asking us our career goals and actively reaching out to help us achieve them. Less top down busy work. Less mistrust and contempt of faculty by administrators. Increased respect for faculty&#39;s voice. Acting like we matter to the institution. Recognizing our work. Seeking to build us up, instead of always making us feel we aren&#39;t doing enough. We haven&#39;t gotten any real recognition of all the work we had to do to help students during COVID. No one cares about our mental health, work load, etc. The work just keeps piling on, and yet we are expected to keep producing creative/research works without support or funding. The faculty who hold up the institution with teaching and service are undervalued. Only the faculty who bring in big grant $ seem to get rewarded or recognized.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Deepen opportunities for faculty to research, and produce maximally. Create greater diversity, both in ideas and in campus presence of other populations. Build a greater basis for collegial life; this university is very alienating, and sometimes feels impersonal, because faculty have very scant opportunities to meet, interact, socialize, examine each other&#39;s work, and generally live a collegial life! The University often tends to think of faculty, it seems, as workers and contractors, not as a Deanry of scholars, engaged in high research in a community of knowledge. This in my mind, affects the relationship between work, and the essence of the work done in the university. The university has to offer in sum, an equal acknowledgement of faculty doing work whether in the Humanities or in Science, or in Engineering, or the Social Sciences; and stop creating an academic apartheid of privileges that tend to segregate accomplishments and create dissatisfaction!</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">My department&#39;s culture is one of gossip behind closed doors, a small cabal influencing the chair and everyone else being ignored, and general hostility among faculty that no one will even admit. It&#39;s hard to articulate how the institution as a whole could change this, but the &#34;it&#39;s only the individuals&#34; explanations don&#39;t help either. The fact is, the institution sets out constant competition as the ideal, and this makes it hard for sub-units to do anything else. The university always puts programs into place that superficially seem to provide resources and change, but that aren&#39;t substantive and do not really effect any change. They just require us to receive more email spam and bureaucratic requirements when what we actually need is to cut administrative offices and use that funding to provide lighter teaching loads, regular sabbaticals, and other kinds of day-to-day support for faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">teaching load</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Increase the opportunity, by department, for course releases in recognition of service-related work. For example, I am currently teaching [&gt;=3] classes (with over 600 students), serving as [administrative role] (for hundreds of majors), and serving as an internship advisor (which is essentially a 5th course)...with NO COURSE RELEASE. I only receive one course release in Fall term, not Spring. And per my chair, it&#39;s because they can&#39;t afford a second course release.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Someone has to do something about the devastating effect of teaching in a pandemic to our research. [Home university] was NEVER very good about research in the humanities BUT now, it&#39;s terrible.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Change the structure for deciding teaching loads. Do not allow this to be decided by mid level supervisors or coordinators. Provide more shared governance with regard to teaching assignments by not only asking what faculty want to teach, but by also respecting those wishes or at least providing solid rationale when they are not respected.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Hire more faculty to support the increasing numbers of students and provide the resources these faculty need to do their research and creative work.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Recruit high quality students.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Base salary for lecturers is very low. In addition, lecturers get overlooked in comparison to tenured or tenured track faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">There are some faculty members shouldering tremendous service loads that are not compensated for in any way, especially when those faculty members are non tenure earning. The discrepancy between faculty there can be tremendous. Faculty who carry substantially larger service workloads should be compensated with course release.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Teacher/student ratio, I would stop increasing the cap on number of students per class.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reconfigure the [Interdisciplinary College]. The creation of this college destroyed the work of the College of [Field].</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Especially with COVID-19 pandemic, leadership at the department, college, and university levels need to be more supportive of faculty and staff. We are going out of our way to transition courses, assist students, care for our kids and elderly parents, and attend a dramatic increase in meetings. Some grace and understanding will go a long way. Morale is very low across multiple units at this time. We are tired and exhausted. Asking us to increase class limits, teach more courses, serve on more committees, etc. is not the answer. Enough!</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Support faculty via paid sabbaticals and encourage them to take them. Especially after the pandemic. Academic burnout is real.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reduced teaching load and class size.  The leadership at this institution states that they are aiming for R1 status.  But it is unreasonable to expect faculty to perform R1 level research with an R2-R3 teaching load.  While our department provides an attractive package for new faculty, existing faculty have a relatively high teaching load and there is little to no GTA support.  Funding expectations are extremely high in spite of the high teaching load.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Allow for a better balance between research and teaching. While the faculty in my department teach a fairly large number of courses, we are still being evaluated based on our research performance.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Decrease number of committees</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Hold students to higher standards of learning.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Provide more support after securing an external grant.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The overall support for research infrastructure is abysmal.  The university claims to have the goal of becoming a top tier research university, but there is almost no support for research faculty and it is nearly impossible to compete with other institutions for research funding.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Pay people. Pay adjuncts a fee that is not insulting. Teaching a 3 credit hour class is worth way more than [amount].  Not to mention we now expect adjuncts to teach online and they have to go through mandatory training that they don&#39;t get paid for!  Pay faculty members, especially new faculty members, a respectable wage. New faculty in my department are offered [amount] with no negotiation allowed--take it or leave it.  How are we supposed to attract the highest quality faculty with that?  I&#39;ve been here more than [number] years and that is only [amount] more than my starting salary.  Seriously, [amount] increase in starting pay in more than [number] years?!?! It is lip service to say we are trying to attract the best faculty. Paying a reasonable salary and recruiting high quality faculty would have a significant positive impact on my workplace.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The way raises are managed is abhorrent. First, the fact that faculty are COMPETING with each other for TIPS and other awards and that THIS is the primary path to getting a raise (outside of promotion) is demeaning. Tons of hours go into those binders/applications for *proving* we are worthy of a raise, and sometimes there are far too many suitable applicants than there are awards to go around. This, combined with the fact that the union needs to negotiate any other cost of living raises, means that the cost of living wage increase is not commensurate with cost of living increases. When my children are finished with school, there will be little reason for me to stay here in way of compensation for my work.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Recognize, and compensate for, the almost insurmountable workload we have, especially during these unprecedented times as we&#39;ve all worked essentially double the amount of hours to adapt/teach virtually with other responsibilities, and ensure equitable treatment of, and opportunities, for all faculty. Due to the limited amount of university-wide opportunities for awards, grants, and leadership opportunities, this promotes competition amongst faculty and hinders interdisciplinary collaboration as well as collaboration within departments. High amount of workloads (teaching large enrolled classes, teaching many classes, teaching many nights and 3 days per week, and doing this in additional to expectations for service, professional development, and being high-performing non-tenure earning research faculty for a low amount of pay) already creates additional stress, but opportunities for support are limited and our college most recently eliminated all of our departmental administrative support as well. Create more opportunities for faculty who are NEW (less than 5 years with [institution]) AND non tenure earning to receive support (teaching assistants), recognition, awards, course releases of time to conduct research or engage in fellowships as well as formal mentorship from senior faculty within their department, college, university, and outside of the university if they request it.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">System for Lecturer level to participate in research - there is no hope of advancing career if there is no opportunity for research - the only opportunity we have is for teaching awards!</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Capping class sizes in online courses to something more reasonable or providing additional TA support.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Provide a transition for Faculty in Non-Tenure lines to be promoted or transition to Tenure lines.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The service expectations are improving but still get in the way of teaching.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">If you are going to act like a for-profit corporation, develop a system that rewards the productive, dedicated employee. The teaching loads for non-tenure track faculty are not conducive to having time to gather and collate all of the information required to get recognition. The [course evaluations] are subjective and unfair. I have years of high ratings and complimentary reviews and one semester with very detrimental reviews. This has held me back for applying for [teaching incentive] awards and promotion until it falls off the [number] year report period. In the years since those reviews the students have garnered enough negative faculty action to prove there was personal motivation in their reviews.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Allow faculty to participate in meetings virtually when they are in remote locations. My college is physically isolated from main campus. Attending meetings in person is a big drain on my research time, to drive, find parking, locate the building etc. I&#39;m hopeful that this opportunity will be possible now that all departments have experienced working remotely during the pandemic.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Excellence in everything from the tiniest detail to the largest. Being a large entity is no excuse to tolerate incompetence in anything, which happens way too much at [home institution].</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Consistent salary increases to match changes in cost of living and the elimination of competitive awards that put faculty against one another</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">More leadership and advancement opportunities for non-tenure earning faculty.  Most (if not all) leadership opportunities require full professor tenured status.  There is limited advancement for non-tenure earning faculty wanting to pursue administrative roles at this institution.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Recognize the financial stresses and huge anoumt of time involved remote work has caused and give us a proper raise of base salary.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Summer salary is not &#34;supplemental&#34; when your research requires you to work in the summer (e.g. field research). We need 3 grants to cover summer salary in full, which is of course a challenge to acquire, keep up through time, and have a work-life balance of any kind. On top of that, there is no &#34;vacation time&#34; for 9-month faculty. So if you have 3 grants and have a full salary, then you have no life, no vacation, and endless stress. That it is a terrible model for satisfaction.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Balance teaching load with research expectations among departmental faculty of all ranks.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">consider a more proper balance between administration, teaching and research for faculty. Administrative duties are not valued or compensated properly.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">At college meetings, teaching should be discussed more.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Improve faculty to student ratio. I regularly teach 900+ students in a semester with no lecture TA support.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I feel that our department is not reaching it&#39;s full potential by undercutting the quality of student work, focusing on community art over museum quality work, and not providing enough research time/offices to non-tenure track earning faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The desire to be the &#34;largest&#34; university as far a student numbers without the support/infrastructure.  Having high level science classes with enrollments in 400-500 per section is absurd and not what I would call providing a quality education.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I don&#39;t feel supported when I report bad behavior by faculty.  As a [administrative role], I hear numerous stories about faculty behaving badly.  These reports come from undergraduate students, graduate students, and colleagues.  I send these reports upward, but nothing ever happens.  I have [number] faculty in my department who regularly abuse students (not physically), I have reported each of them at least 4=5 times, and nothing has ever happened to them.  As [administrative role], that makes me look like I&#39;m not doing anything about these reports.  I feel like the only faculty who experience repercussions for their behavior are faculty who are REALLY offensive (and probably make the news). This makes it extremely hard to be a [administrative role].</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The constant push to be #1 or the &#34;best&#34; in all things is like working in an institution that is constantly striving to compete with the better and more recognized older sibling (i.e., [other state universities]). It is a type of self-absorption that is tiring and embarrassing.  First, the university was all about grow, grow, grow.  Now its all about aspiring to some national status.  Either way, faculty expectations are constantly changing and growing more demanding.  The publication norms are ridiculous in my department. It is not possible for a sole person to meet them.  Someone would have to be constantly working with a group of people where the division of labor is so splintered that it is possible to get 3 publications a year. It is not possible for 1 person to do this.  So you are essentially no longer being evaluated based on what you and you alone can do. Everything at this university is a numbers game.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">There&#39;s a mismatch between wanting to be seen as an innovative, high-research productivity institution, but saddling faculty with extremely large course sizes and not enough teaching load reductions for performing other dutues.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">My biggest complaint is how COVID was handled. Faculty were shocked that decisions were made based entirely on political force and lacked any emphasis on pedagogy or faculty safety. It was also shocking the administration sent a survey to students, but not faculty, about return to campus preferences. Luckily, the Faculty Senate stepped up in that regard.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Teaching and working with students should be the #1 priority.    Faculty research and scholarship takes over so that focus is on individual faculty members and what they achieve  rather on what we are doing to support  our college students.  Our focus should always be first on our students and the role they will be play  in our community - and beyond.  I know that research/scholarship supports that; however, it often oftertakes and overwhelms the focus on students and curriculum.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Administration should respect faculty decisions regarding program design &amp; content as well as student policies.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I&#39;d like my institution leaders to value faculty who are not tenured but that are reliable, present, enthusiastic about their work and dedicated to their craft. Maybe one is not getting a top dollar grant or an outstanding award, but what they do on a daily basis for their students should be also recognized as valuable. Since COVID hit, for instance, when most faculty chose not to be back to the classrooms, faculty who did so were barely acknowledged, despite being a mere handful out of dozens. There was almost no recognition of the fact that these faculty members prioritized their many students who were vocal about wanting to be on campus and braved a full semester of face to face classes with responsibility and utmost care, and ended their semester dutifully and without any issues or hazard to themselves of their students.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">have dedicated pre-award team for each federal agency</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">At this point, my institution needs to support faculty who have been impacted by covid.  The daycare on campus still is only open from 9-3:30.  That is UNTENABLE, faculty students and staff need full time child care.  Those of us with young children and aging parents that we care for have been more impacted than others.  You should implement course and/or service releases that people can apply for to get back on track. You should offer research refresh grants to help people get back on track.  You could offer grants to help faculty with child or dependent care. I am begging you to do some of these things, especially open the [childcare center] to its full pre-covid hours (we still pay the same price for 4-5 hours less of care by the way).  Especially women faculty have been impacted by this, if you want inequality persisting for years after this, that is what you are looking at if you do nothing.  Please help.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The university focuses touch of its energy in non essential activities or fads. Just focus in good teaching amd good research.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reduce teaching load to encourage more scholarly activities. Reduce class sizes for more effective teaching and engagement.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I am pleased with my institution overall but one disappointment this year was the response to moving work from office to home, the uncertainty (or unwillingness to commit to a decision) and subsequent failure to be sure that faculty (and staff) had adequate resources needed to perform their work at home. The one area that would be useful to me is helping faculty at the end of their careers. There is much support for faculty in early stages of career and some in mid stages, but little support for late career faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Offer long-term contracts to I/Ls who have been here for 5-10 years and do not want to leave.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Our teaching load is high and we aren&#39;t provided sufficient teaching assistant support.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">1) Do not reward toxic, under performing tenured colleagues who make every one else&#39;s life miserable.  2) Increase salary  3) Fund Graduate students completely.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">As a tenure-earning faculty member, I find it appalling that I am expected to produce grants, research and publications with an FTE of [number] for research. The teaching and service loads are extremely high and no one seems to care or want to help. In my humble opinion, the tenured faculty and administration in my department do not seem to care about my quality of life or stress that I am under.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I think the [institution] faculty could be more supportive of visible and non-visible disabled faculty and students.  I am not given a fair promotion process, my main concern is the continuing belief that disabled students need to &#34;report&#34; to faculty to receive their accommodations, this is wholly unfair this is the largest minority in the United States and they are not given equal access.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Allow faculty members to use the tuition vouchers (for early course registration, instead of the last day). Making faculty members or their family members wait until the last day to register is ridiculous and they know it. These cannot successfully be used for undergraduate courses. It speaks volumes as to how much [institution] doesn&#39;t care.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Invest in infrastructure for all research levels, improve research facilities for all faculty members, not just NEW faculty. Current faculty are working in substandard conditions and expected to make great contributions, yet have no opportunity to innovative factilites for research since arrival. Move to new labs, or research centers. We are expected to provide research opportunities for undergraduates but have no space, nor resources to mentor UG or G adequately.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Focus on Educating Students and on Quality Instruction, not on being the largest (number-wise) university in the US. Even though it has been said that we aren&#39;t trying to be the biggest, that doesn&#39;t translate when looking at the class size of many courses. When there are more than 25/30 students in a class, an instructor cannot give the feedback and attention students need.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I would like to see a complete overhaul in the &#34;non-tenure&#34; track faculty approach.  First, that name, &#34;non-tenure&#34; track faculty is borderline disrespectful because it focuses on what we don&#39;t have or what we are not rather than who we are and what we do have. That is tremendous strength often in practice and teaching methodology.  Second, there is not a lot of mentoring directly in our department space for non-tenure track faculty. We receive much of our formal mentorship opportunity through our university faculty and teaching center (thank goodness for them--they are great) and our group of non-tenure track faculty within the department have taken it upon ourselves to meet together periodically so we can talk about our opportunities and challenges. But there is not a formal mentorship process that I have been a part of at the department or even college level.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">allow faculty to determine choice of textbooks and creation of their own class materials, flexibility and assignments in classes. Also, provide reliable and experienced Research office support at both the college and university level.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The university needs to have more properly managed shared resources for faculty. There are few facilities ([research facilities]) that faculty can use and [research facility] has some outdated equipment. Some centers have their own equipment, but this is not open to all faculty and the billing structure is strange. My students and I spend considerable amounts of time locating equipment on campus and then get frustrated with the lack of access. It is a mess.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">quicker support when things are needed physically and administratively.  It takes FOREVER to get things approved and accomplished!</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Recognize and support scholarship and creativity in the liberal arts disciplines as worthy of time, support, and attention. Quit using us as nothing more than [gen ed] teachers mass producing SCHs.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Taking a look at the full picture of what the job is like for the lower paid contingent faculty and those of us on 1-year contracts (who are the folks who also carry the heaviest teaching load). Constantly changing schedules, summer assignments being like a game with unknown rules, paying for our own parking and then having to fight for parking, no official rules/guidance on how departments should handle family obligations so it&#39;s all up to how a department chair feels about children/families, unrelenting pressure to perform and compete for things like awards to increase salary, etc. It&#39;s a pressure cooker, and yet, we also are reminded how thankful we should be that we get to be in this situation since SO MANY people would love to be where we are (which keeps many of us from speaking out).</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I would like to see [institution] make more effort to retain female faculty. We have lost a number of excellent female faculty members due to a variety of reasons: sexual harassment, undervaluing/underpaying female faculty, a lack of equity between male and female faculty, and it is harder for female faculty to be promoted at [institution].</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">They need to reinstate the policy allowing spouses to serve on student committees and research grants together. They need to get rid of the current [leadership position] for Research and the Graduate College.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Recognize the role of instructor as the backbone of the teaching duties at the university and taking advantage of the instructor&#39;s strength. Not giving recognition with awards for less effective teaching to people who are on a tenure track so that it &#34;looks good&#34;. Not giving substandards faculty teaching opportunities just because they have PhD and taking them away from a more qualified instructor.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">There are so many things [institution] needs to do to improve our workplace.  1. [institution] needs to determine if we are still striving for preeminent status.  If we are then give faculty the resources and support they need to produce high quality research.  It is not fair to expect high quality research when we are teaching 5 very large courses a year with no GTA and no RA.  2. The [school] has base salaries that are below market rate for our discipline.  Yet, our dean expects us to teach 5 courses during the year with continuing class size increases and publish a minimum of [1 journal article in top tier journals per year.  We have no RA no GTA.  It is incredibly frustrating.  3.  When I was hired I was told by the previous dean that summer teaching of two courses would always be available. This made the pay relatively comparable to other institutions (although I had to work an additional 6 weeks).  Our new dean now says that teaching two classes may not be available. Thus making my salary below market rate for my discipline.  These miscommunications should not occur because of a change of leadership.  4.  The lack of support to convert classes from face  to face to online overnight due to the pandemic was astonishing.  Incredible amounts of time went into the conversion with very limited support from [institution]. This is shameful.  5.  The lack of support for conducting research during the pandemic is also shameful on the part of [institution].  6.  There seems to be an incredible disconnect between [institution]&#39;s overall goals and my dean&#39;s goals.  It is confusing to understand one message from the dean and then to watch the president&#39;s report and hear a different message.  For example, is [institution] trying to grow or not?</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Equity - currently a real lack of equity in pay, workload, expectations, class sizes, tenure requirements, etc. between colleges and even departments.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Stop focusing on growth and support higher quality teaching and resources, equally across the University.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I really feel burned out by the amount of service I have.  it does not seem like other faculty have half as much.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Allow long distance or at home work/ teaching for faculty, especially those in dual career couples. Allow online office hours, online participation to committee and department meetings, [teaching and learning center] conferences, and other activities. The pandemic has shown we can work, teach, collaborate effectively from home. Especially in situations where faculty have accumulated a [time period] or more of being in long distance dual career couples, our work-life balance suffers tremendously and so does our morale. We have the technology to allow more flexibility in this kind of situations, and accommodate those who, due to family circumstances, show a real need for this kind of accommodation.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">financial support, continued ability to deliver courses via Zoom meetings, prioritizing preferences of professors regarding safety</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Invest in our research infrastructure from the staff who support our research endeavors and the facilities needed to maintain our labs and the new technology needed to be competitive for federal grants..</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I would very much like to see additional resources and attention devoted to research and scholarship. In my department for the last five years or so, there has been no focus on research, recognizing research, supporting research. It&#39;s just so strange to have research and scholarship be such a vital and generative part of my professional life, but have it be so absent from any discussion or action in my department. From what I gather, my department is mostly focused on getting faculty involved in and supporting their efforts toward various kinds of departmental service. Over the past five years in my department, tenure-line and tenured faculty have never once had an opportunity to come together to talk about the status and value of research/scholarship in the department, or to talk with the department chair about how to support that work.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reduce central admin.  All they seem to do is invent useless task for faculty, e.g., this survey.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Office of Research needs better [direction]. While federal funding is a priority, little thought or guidance is given to other forms. Zero support has been provided industry grants, which are processed like federal grants.  Doesn&#39;t make sense.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Improve compensation so we will be competitive in attracting and retaining world class researchers and a more diverse faculty.  Although this could be consider a second issue, the teaching load for most faculty is far greater than that of peer institutions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Compensation must be tied to merit and performance.  I have never earned less than an Outstanding rating on my annual evaluations in [number] years on the faculty at [institution], yet always receive the exact same tiny across the board raise or a few hundred dollars of “bonus” that people who are far less accomplished receive.    After a decade of this I no longer feel compelled to excel.  Why should I not just tread water like the others if I am not going to be recognized or rewarded for my consistently “outstanding” level of performance?  Why do we even HAVE annual evaluations if they are not tied to compensation?  I assure you that my high performing colleagues feel identically, because we talk about it every time “raises” are announced. [Institution] has alienated its top performers by giving them the same participation trophy that those who aren’t as effective (or in some cases outright incompetent) receive.  This is incredibly shortsighted and has begun to cause a measurable decline in faculty output.  There simply is no motivation to excel, so why bother?    While the faculty “union” is largely responsible for this socialist nonsense, the administration is only too willing to agree because it saves them money.  Those of us who are consistently outstanding are easing back on the extra effort because there is no discernible benefit to strive for excellence.    The result from this, as with all socialist policies, is ubiquitous mediocrity.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">For the workload as well as other duties (committees, career fair, etc.), I think the salary structure could be increased.  The cost of living in [city] is extremely high.  It would be beneficial to all if [institution] could come up to the salary standards that the other major universities have in the state of [southern state].</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I think that [institution] would best be improved by hiring more (quality) tenure track professors. Growing the faculty will increase the research output of the university which will increase national and international recognition of  [institution]. This will increase grant funding at  [institution], help us recruit better graduate students, and reduce teaching loads both to improve the faculty&#39;s work life and the quality of our undergraduate and graduate education.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">We need more professors of color in our departments and we need more PhD professors in the [School]. I would like to see the research profile of [the school] raised.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Improvement is needed in equity of work-load across faculty. There is a strong bias to overload people who have high work-ethic, quality of work to receive more work than those who do not perform as well. There is also a bias toward tenured faculty as untouchable, regardless of ethical behavior.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">more equitable teaching loads across departments and colleges and lower student to faculty ratio</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">[Institution] administration needs to show faculty with actions that they recognize that faculty are the reason [institution] is as good as it is, and that if we&#39;re going to become an R1, then faculty are the ones to do it. So we need [institution]&#39;s support to make that happen. E.g., [institution] could try to: get the amount of bureaucractic nonsense that flows to department chairs and to faculty under control, bargain in good faith with our faculty union, provide adequate grant support for research-active faculty, institute more policies that help our work-life balance, etc.  I feel like the top levels at [institution] (president, provost, VP for research) would agree with all of this, but sometimes I feel like that other levels of administration aren&#39;t yet onboard.  More generally, [institution] needs to keep fighting back against the pressure from the state/BOG to convert us into a technical college full of gig adjuncts teaching 5-5. Yes there are difficult issues in being an enormous university and being subject to the whim of state funding and state regulations, and there&#39;s no doubt that everyone here is working hard, but somehow we have to step back, assess, and do better for our faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Allow each academic unit to fill all open faculty lines. My unit has [&lt;5] open T/TE lines that we are told we cannot fill. This creates a tremendous teaching and service burden on the rest of us, and also, is a barrier to overall scholarship quantity in the unit.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">With [number] students and just under [number] faculty, we cannot pretend to offer practical experience to most of our students, as all research universities must.  We play at it, and some departments achieve it through the accident of having few majors, but we are not, on the whole, a research university.  Many departments&#39; majors outnumber the faculty 100:1.  It is impossible for those faculty to offer any meaningful research or scholarly experience to most of the majors, nor is it possible for them to place their students in research experiences elsewhere.  Until we can bring our enrollment and faculty size in line with each other, we will not be a top-[number] research university, and some would argue we will not really be a research university at all.  This effort needs to be an all-fronts battle.  We cannot reduce students without reducing faculty, given how the state allocates funds, unless we raise money in other ways.  We need to reduce students AND sell our product to the state to change their allocation formulas AND raise funds from other sources.  Recent changes in leadership give this a hope of happening, but it will take time, perhaps more time than many will have patience for.  It will be utterly critical to retain [President] and the outstanding leadership team he is building.  It is equally critical to incorporate these goals into his goals from the Board, and to hold him and his team accountable to them.  I&#39;m hopeful, but if this doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;m leaving.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reduce service</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Clarity in the tenure process and requirements. Specific requirements that departments hold for tenure-earners so that they can know precisely what to do and how they stack up. More flexibility with teaching to avoid burnout and allow significant research time. More base pay to support the ability to research.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">This University is too top-down. Many decisions are made at the top without respect for faculty. For example, teaching face to face without a vaccine during covid times, and not allowing for much faculty flexibility.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Improve the teaching environment by significantly reducing the very large student to faculty ratio and dedicated funds to improving classroom facilities and course management support software.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">This institution is overly bureaucratic compared to other institutions at which I have worked; too many policies, too much paperwork, too much mandatory training, it takes too long to get simple things accomplished.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reduce the effective teaching load, ideally by hiring more faculty.  At least in [STEM discipline], our student/faculty ratio is 2-3 times that of our peer and comparably ranked institutions.  Moreover, TA support for the load has actually decreased as well; even in the [number of] years I have taught here, the typical ratio of students/TA in a course has doubled.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">To compete in research with other institutions, the range of equipment and instrumentation (e.g., at [center for research]) needs to be expanded and made more accessible (lower hourly rates, no additional cost to train students).</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">If it is seriously committed to not pursuing the growth model of administrations past, it should communicate that to the colleges clearly who continue to push a growth model, privileging student credit hours over everything, including research productivity. If they want to be a research institution, they should start acting like one.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Every process from grant submission to approval of travel appears to have been designed by Rube Goldberg. It’s opaque, excessively hierarchical, and over litigated to the nth degree.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">reduction of class sizes and teaching loads</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Allow for more &#34;professors of [practice]&#34; - those of us who provide exceptional teaching and industry connections without such a one-dimensional focus on research.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Focus on the goal of educating the public.  That goal has been largely displaced by a preoccupation with diversity and inclusivity initiatives.  Simultaneously, our undergraduate class sizes are vastly larger than they should be.  [Institution] is a diploma mill.  Academic standards are routinely compromised in the name of diversity, inclusivity, and inattention by course instructors.  This trend ultimately undermines the central role played by institutions of higher learning for the past millennia.  I implore you - reallocate resources from D&amp;I to student training in methods of rationality, improvement of laboratory science training for students from all disciplines, writing-intensive coursework, and reduction of class sizes.  Grade inflation further undermines the legitimacy of our work and must be addressed.  Maybe, just maybe, if we are genuinely concerned with equitable treatment of persons and equity in undergraduate enrollment, we may devote some attention to addressing the most substantive disparity on campus - the shortage of men in college classrooms.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Administration has a long history of not being transparent and engaging in shared governance, and that was expected to change in the past year with a new admin, but decisions made with respect to remote work and the pandemic have not seemed in line with that expectation.  Lecturers (non tenure-track lines) receive no mentoring, little support, have no ability to negotiate raises (likelihood of receiving outside offers is next to nil when they are not conducting research actively)</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I often marked &#34;teaching load,&#34; but I would&#39;ve selected &#34;class size&#34; if it had been an option. Class size at [institution] is out of control, and the #1 contributing cause to my own constant stress and dissatisfaction with my job.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Research and grant expectations are too high which lead to fewer efforts in teaching and service among faculty</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reduce the emphasis on money as criteria of success</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Provide administrative accountability. I trust no support member to actually do their job. It is exhausting, and makes me dislike my job.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Faculty salaries, esp. for non-tenure earning faculty, continue to lag behind peer institutions. The university has a drive to constantly innovate and push forward new initiatives—which leads to both an attractive sense of possibility that gets many faculty excited to work here, but also potential feelings of burnout over time. Recognizing via compensation the work teaching-focused faculty do to keep the university moving forward and promote student success would go a long way towards helping NTE faculty be successful here. Promotion for NTE faculty is valuable, but base salaries still lag significantly, especially for faculty who have been here for longer. Tying salary increases almost exclusively to competitive processes like [teaching awards] (that reward individual effort) seems to perhaps work against the sort of collaboration the university seeks to promote, especially interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Resource for research</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I think the number one thing that my University could do to improve working conditions would be to change the bonus system currently in place. The primary bonus system is called [name] and it is a system that I feel unfairly awards individuals based upon who you&#39;re friends with on the award committee as opposed to actual hard work. It is very difficult in that many department&#39;s are understaffed and as such have classes and teaching loads that are quite larger then in previous years. These teachers are unable to do creative and unique activities because of the number of students they have. However our bonus structure is based on recognizing these activities. When faculty do not have the ability to engage in the same creative aspects that other department&#39;s do with smaller student populations, it fundamentally makes this system unfair.   The second change I would recommend is better treatment for non tenure track faculty. These individuals are known as either lecturers or instructors at our University and are the backbone of teaching students. However administration and leadership at our institution devalue their worth by not allowing them to serve on committees that only tenure track individuals can serve. There is also higher pay for these individuals than non tenure tract faculty. In the past there was a thought of changing the name of these individuals to teaching professors but tenure track faculty fought this very hard because they did not want to share the title of professor with individuals who &#34;just teach&#34; and do not do research. The primary purpose of the University is to educate students. These individuals are the ones who are teaching large class loads and getting in credit hours to enable professors to do research. They are extremely undervalued and there should be an effort to recognize there accomplishments in contributions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Graduate students are the foundation of a research university. Our administration -- from the [institution] Office of Student Financial Assistance, up to and including the President of [institution], have demonstrated an unsettling lack of understanding as to the role of graduate students -- who they are, what they do, and how they contribute to our university&#39;s mission. [Institution] has lofty ambitions of expanding its international recognition and prominence as an R1 research institution, and yet our base graduate stipends are several thousand dollars below the estimated poverty line for the [regional] area. Particularly worrisome is the treatment (and at times, outright disrespect) towards our graduate students of color -- not necessarily at the individual level, but at the institutional level. For example, the Office of Student Financial Assistance routinely fails to distribute external funding to our graduate students in a timely manner. In one particularly egregious incident, I understand that a PhD student of color was instructed to take out personal loans to make ends meet until his external fellowship -- which was awarded to promote diverse representation in STEM -- came through. In fact the funds had already been transferred to [institution], and there was no legitimate excuse for the delay. Nevertheless, the student was told that nothing could be done, and the student became visibly upset (and justifiably so). In response, rather than attempting to look into the issue to help the student, this graduate student of color was threatened with removal by security. A few hours later, a white male colleague in my department made a phone call to a white male administrator, and the funds were released to the student on the very same day. I share this anecdote because this shameful incident is a consistent pattern with [institution] -- performative dialogue regarding both 1) research excellence and 2) diversity and inclusion, while our very own students too often fall between the cracks. I also share this because I know we can do better. I am happy to acknowledge [institution]&#39;s attempts at progress over the last year, but there is a very long way to go before [institution] is truly an inclusive environment. Expanding resources for graduate students -- most importantly, raising the base stipend to *at least* a living wage -- would be substantially more effective at improving our recruitment/retention abilities for both graduate students and faculty, and would simultaneously make [institution] a more hospitable environment for our students of color. To conclude, it is my view that the single greatest threat to [institution]&#39;s continued success is its lack of investment in graduate students. While it is certainly not too late to address the issue, we are moving too slowly, and risk being left in the dust by our peer institutions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">A sincere effort from the leadership at the University level to really listen and work closely with the faculty to solve larger as well as day-to-day issues to improve research and teaching at this great institution.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Provide adequate teaching staff (faculty and graduate teaching assistants)to support teaching the number of students we have. [Institution] keeps admitting more and more undergraduate students but does not hire proportionally more faculty or teaching assistants. The faculty-to-student ratio is out of control, in my unit it&#39;s over 70 students per faculty member. The national average is 18:1.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">To improve the quality of research, we need to have more focused and collegial group and environment. We are currently lack of a definite development training and system for research junior faculty development. They are facing multiple challenges in particular after Covid-19 pandemic.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Set compensation based on the number of students a faculty member teaches each academic year.  Ensure there is no difference in pay scale between tenured and non-tenured faculty members.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Provide course releases or other professional benefits for being engaged in service opportunities. I&#39;m on 10,000 committees and have no time for anything else. [institution] needs to take a hard look at what it asks from its faculty in terms of service and unnecessary &#34;stuff.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Don&#39;t leave faculty positions unfilled when someone leaves or retires. When that happens, the load falls on those of us who are here. And it&#39;s getting to be crushing. And patching it with adjuncts doesn&#39;t work because we have to take time to train and manage the adjuncts. Thank you.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">more seed funds for new research avenues</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">We need to reduce enrollment or higher a substantial number of additional staff and faculty to work in the academic units, not in the colleges and not in central admin.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Support for grant preparation for external funding can definitely be improved, as it is an expectation for tenure. At my previous institution (an R1 institution), the [research office] did all the heavy lifting and the PI only focused on the science. More often than I would like to acknowledge, I find myself doing administrative work that could be done by the [research office]. Examples include chasing letters of support at the 11th hour, creating institutional descriptions from scratch (when these could be boiler-plate templates to use consistently), or negotiating contracts for external grant reviewers. As much as I appreciate the efforts made by the [research office], the teaching load is extremely heavy, and researchers could use all the help to do the heavy administrative lifting to better focus on the science behind the grants.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">We have a wonderful program, unique nationally, and accomplishing much more than others with much larger budgets.  However, a previous administration changed the policy on awards (Pegasus, etc.) and grants that provided a good portion of our operating budget, imperiling our activities.  We are hoping this situation gets rectified and our value to the university is appreciated.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">With a new president, my hope is high that [he/she] may bring a new vision (quality over quantity) and transparency to decision-making processes.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Teaching, research, and service are not &#34;9 to 5&#34; jobs. Recognition of this by the administration and allowing for flexible hours and work from home (without having to formally request it) would hugely benefit my productivity, job satisfaction, and overall quality of life. The workload is incredibly high in my department, but I enjoy my work so I don&#39;t mind, but being given the flexibility to meet these high demands would be wonderful.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reduce teaching load and class sizes. We teach very large classes in my department, and the quality of our courses has suffered as a result. Faculty are stretched too thin to do top-quality work with all of the classes and students they teach. A number of my colleagues also seem overwhelmed with their workloads and have only avoided burn-out by slacking off with their teaching obligations.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I feel my institution could do a better job in bringing professor&#39;s inventions to market. There is a significant investment in patenting intellectual property here at [institution]. However, very few patented ideas make it to market. We need a better way to vet and translate our discoveries from bench to bedside in the [medical school] for example. Perhaps more support for translating discoveries to marketable products/applications would be a good investment for our future.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">My institution has promoted a &#34;bigger is better&#34; philosophy and I currently have 600+ undergraduate students.  Maintaining quality of instruction in the face of unrelenting population pressure and minimal institutional support is challenging and frankly depressing.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Too many students per faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">[Institution] is an excellent place to work for its fairness, clarity, and non-discrimination environment. The salary and other benefits are acceptable. However, as a Lecturer, I have the following severe issues:  - Teacher and student ratio is insane when taking 4+3 courses in two semesters. It turns out that in a semester a teacher might need to deal with 800 to 1000 students. Also, if a course has labs, it can become 32 different sections to manage by the teacher in a particular semester. Thanks to [institution] for providing grading and TA supports, however, the teacher also needs to manage this large group for proper task assignment, monitoring, rubric preparation, etc. The number of loads makes it difficult for me to balance my life and health, some semesters I lost weight a lot to deal with the semester&#39;s loads.  As a lecturer, 4+3 is perfectly fine for me if the teacher to student ratio is decreased significantly. More students mean more issues and a lot more emails and overall lot more things to manage. Also, it becomes difficult to give good feedback to students, difficult to understand the class status and individual student&#39;s status, and at the end, it might badly affect the student&#39;s performance as well as student evaluation to the teacher.   [Institution] and especially my department should strongly consider this issue which significantly affects the life of the lecturers.  My strong suggestion would be to reduce the teacher/student ratio. Maybe when the number of students in a course is more than 100 or other thresholds, then count every 100 students as a single course in the teaching load count.  Also, if a course has a lab, it should be also considered in the teaching load assignment with some different policy. Otherwise, it will be unfair to the teacher who is teaching courses with labs compared to the teacher who does not have labs.  For example, teacher1 is taking 4 courses without any labs and he has total of 4x80 = 320 students. On the other hand, teacher2 is taking 4 courses with all labs. He has total 4 x 250 = 1000 students with 32 sections including labs. This type of distribution is completely unfair. For teacher2, the number of courses must be decreased to make it relatively fair.  - The differences between the salaries of the non-tenure track faculty (Lecturer) and tenure track faculty are extremely high. It is understandable they have a research load, however, they have also a very low teaching load.  The salary differences look very unfair.  - With such a teaching load with so many students to a lecturer, the salary needs to be significantly increased. A faculty can earn the same amount with a significantly low student load in another place. So, it should be considered to retain the faculty. I know my friends who are Assistant professors/Lecturers at other universities. They have low research pressure, and also a small teaching load with only a few students per class. They are earning much more than me. Overall, people in other places might have a similar course load like us, but with a very small class size. However, they earn more than us which is very discouraging. I hope [institution] will consider this pressure on the teachers and adjust salary accordingly.  Thanks for the opportunity to express my thought.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">This institution is absolutely a traditional &#34;publish or perish&#34; environment that has not considered the changing academic and world environment around research, student engagement, and value of publications over the sheer number of them and in what journals.

            <li><span class="comments">By focusing on &#34;scale&#34; we have lost the ability to selectively chose the best graduate students from around the world and thus, we have lost the ability to positively IMPACT research. [Institution] hires graduate students indiscriminately and thus, our STEM research programs suffer. The entire pipeline (from marketing to recruiting to training to placement) of STEM graduates is broken and unless this is fixed, we will suffer from mediocrity. This needs to change at the University and College levels.   Part of this problem is tied to an existing perception problem with [institution] (when compared to [peer institution] and other [region] Universities such as [peer institution 2]). Part of this problem is also tied to the pervasive culture of mediocrity and low expectations from our UGs; many of whom end up working at retail stores after earning a Bachelors in  Engineering/Sciences.

One of the most striking aspects of coming to [institution] was the amount of red tape and bureaucracy. Nothing seems to be easy – everything seems to take more time and energy than is needed. The influence of risk management seems to be quite high in the university – avoiding legal issues seems to be the primary explanation for all of the extra rules and paperwork. Although I understand the need to minimize risk and to ensure ethical behavior, that emphasis can also become highly burdensome to the point that it decreases the productivity of the faculty. There has to be a reasonable balance. I would love for our leadership to actively seek out where there is unnecessary red tape and do what it can to minimize it – doing so may be one of the most impactful steps that could be taken to increase the productivity of the university faculty. This is especially true in the Office of Research. A great example is when an opportunity comes to bring in a small external contract. I have heard over and over again, and have experienced personally, all the barriers that are put into place when an outside company or institution wants to pay our faculty and/or students to do an applied project for them. Whether it’s due to [institution]’s unreasonable stance on the overhead/indirect rates or the amount of paperwork involved or the length of time it takes to get approved, I have seen or heard of many opportunities that are lost because [institution] simply makes it too hard to bring in this money. This seems inconsistent with the university calling itself the partnership university. This is just one example. The university leadership should actively solicit feedback from faculty on an ongoing basis on what systems or processes are unnecessarily burdensome or difficult, and then take necessary and reasonable steps to fix these issues.   My second suggestion is much more specific. I would love it if the university could figure out a way to efficiently get small pots of money (i.e., less than $5K) to faculty to support their research. I bring in a good amount of external grant money, but those funds are earmarked for very specific purposes. There are internal mechanisms to get research support, but they tend to be larger and/or create a lot of work for everyone (long applications, committees to review the applications, etc.). It would be great if the university could figure out a more efficient way to support faculty research in small ways, especially faculty who have shown that they are highly productive and bring in grant funds to the university. One possibility would be to have a simple automatic way for faculty to get a small seed grant (maybe $3000-5000) every few years. There could be some basic criteria and mechanisms to spread the funds around, hopefully without creating more bureaucracy (e.g., committees that have to review applications, etc.). However, an even easier course of action would be to increase the amount of money from indirects that goes back to the faculty, because right now it is fairly paltry. Maybe it could be some sort of match from the university up to a certain amount. By doing this, faculty who have already proven that they can bring in research funds get rewarded, and the funds go to those who are the most likely to put the funds to use to bring in more funds that would benefit the university. The same could be said for buying out – the university benefits greatly when faculty use grant funds to buy out of teaching, and yet there is actually little additional incentive to do so beyond the reduced teaching load. Again, by incentivizing this type of behavior (e.g., by adding a percentage of the buyout funds to the faculty’s research account), the university would be rewarding behavior that benefits it and puts more funds into the hands of faculty who are most likely to use it in beneficial ways in the future.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Lower teaching load, meaning, lower student per faculty ratio. The resources provides are way below what is needed to sustain quality with such a large number of students. We need more and better space for teaching and research. We are bursting at the seams.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reduce teacher-to- student ratio</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">We have a 70 to 1 student to faculty ratio in our department.  This CANNOT be fixed in any significant way at this point by hiring more faculty, nor will we decrease the number of students (it is actually increasing). They only way to deal with the situation that senior administration has allowed to happen is to get the resources we need to teach that many students.  Our department has more students (4200 undergrads) than some UNIVERSITIES. But we have 6 staff members. Six.  In a class of 250 students we get 2 TAs because the allotment of TA waivers from the [graduate college] to the departments is anemic.  At my previous institution I had 20+ undergrad TAs AND 2 PhD TAs for a class of that size.  We simply teach too many sections of too many students for that pitiful support to make a dent. Students are not getting the personal attention they need to succeed and then it is the faculty&#39;s fault that they are not graduating in high enough percentages after 4 or 5 years.  I wonder why.  We have a ridiculous Administrator and Staff to Faculty ratio (universities should be required to report this).  I could hire all the teach support the department needs for a year at the cost of 1 of our meaningless associate vice president provost senior mumblefrat no one knows what positions in the university or maybe a couple of people from the general counsel&#39;s office.  Enrollment was mismanaged and has spiraled out of control, completely beyond the capability of any one person to dial it back.  Resources have not tracked commensurately (understatement of the year). &#34;Be more creative&#34;.  Come up with novel solutions as faculty to make the current untenable situations we&#39;ve placed you in survivable.  So we have adapted.  We have persisted.  But we are not winning.  It is a losing battle and we are losing our best people to  other places where there is still hope.  Unless a massive---truly MASSIVE shift of resources (and I mean dollars, cold hard cash) is made toward investment in faculty hiring and TA/[undergraduate learning assistant] resources the problem will never be solved.  The best faculty who want to remain loyal will slave away, overworked and underpaid, trying their best to &#34;be creative&#34; and come up with innovative solutions to these administration-created problems, with no acknowledgment of error or even a &#34;we get it and we&#39;re trying to help you&#34; from the administration, but eventually even the strongest will crack and finally crumble.  Leave or retire.  Succumb to the inevitable while the administration&#39;s response will simply be &#34;Charge on.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I am very happy at [institution].</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Keep up the good work!</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The one thing I think that would help is to continue to recognize the value of non-tenure earning (NTE) faculty. [Institution] is better than some other institutions when it comes to this, but there is still what I feel an &#34;outdated&#34; view of NTE faculty. For example, we are the only group to be classified by &#34;what we are not.&#34; I believe there is great value in teaching, and there is also research done on teaching and learning. Recognizing this value as equal to someone pulling in grants and other research I think would be a great step in the right direction.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Take away [guarantee transfer system from partner institutions]; decrease the quantity and increase the quality of transfer students.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">We need to define an institutional identity: The university relatively recently and rather tenuously qualified to lay claim to being R1, yet it still operates much like a very large community college in style and substance (e.g. a R1 university that does not have 24-hour library access?) What are we, really? What does the university feasibly aspire to be?  In this vein, [institution] needs an integrating vision to align more effectively its many disparate and often duplicating efforts. The silo effect besets modern universities across the globe, yes -- largely due to hyper-specialization in the modern academy -- but I have never elsewhere witnessed so many little pockets and enclaves and silos that simply do not speak to each other, even when they have goals in common or overlapping interests.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Create parity between non-tenure earning faculty and tenure earning faculty. In my college it appears TE faculty easily earn promotion and tenure where they would fail at other institutions and NTE faculty are paid substantially less ([percent] in my case for a TE faculty hired [time period] after me with less experience) and expected to do more.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Respect clinical faculty</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Perhaps improve the student-to-teacher ratio... (Many students under very few wings...)</span></li>
