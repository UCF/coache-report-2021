      <p class=""><span>The final question in the COACHE survey asks faculty to describe the one thing your institution can do to improve the workplace for faculty. COACHE analysts assigned all responses to one or more common themes. The following are responses found to be related to this theme.</span>

        <ul>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Improving equity between titles and compensation between non-TT and TT positions. Far too often, lecturers with terminal degrees are hired who take on [class number] loads and do as much or more research as TT faculty but they are compensated much less. Titles for these positions could be improved to improve equity and standing at the University among faculty (e.g. Asst. Professor of Practice rather than Lecturer as a title).</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">To achieve the goal of becoming a true leader in interdisciplinary teaching and research, the workplace requires more balance in the design and revision of joint appointments for humanities faculty for to the success of professional programs and ultimately, to achieve the goal of providing integrative liberal education and research.   These joint appointments to the best of my knowledge fail to calculate the additional burden of: preparing two annual reviews, having two chairs, 2 deans, working at two different distant campuses; working with different academic schedules (9 month x 11 month); adapting to two different academic cultures. Nothing here is the norm for the single department faculty.  The onboarding of joint faculty should be rigorously balanced not to overwhelm and the faculty should be protected and provided special joint mentoring at the university level.   Those joint faculty that accept directorships should be offered at least one course release to rebalance the time used for this role, which requires multiple meetings and faculty development. Preferably, some compensation for the role should be added as well. The phenomenon of someone being a 40% director due to college appointment distribution is an artifact - it is a continuous job and position.    Effective mentoring might be done by panels of joint appointed faculty mentors and follow-ups. Many mentors, while offering support, are not jointly appointed themselves, which limits their perspective. Mentoring should also include administration, for supporting directorship development for assistant professors.  The tenure evaluation of joint appointed faculty needs revision with more attention for preparation and streamlining.   Not least, joint appointments should equitably reflect the pay scale of the work distribution between colleges. The joint appointed faculty is counted for accreditation purposes and provides the linchpin contribution for curriculum development in the professional program. Other universities, for comparison sake, use proportional pay scales for joint appointments, meaning that equal work and comparable job preparation (Phds, etc) are compensated equitably in the professional program with other single appointed faculty.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">The number one thing would be to hire more staff to support faculty with all the administrative things that is pushed down to the faculty level including through all the systems; this includes hiring more advisors at the unit level. Related, have more integration between systems so faculty don&#39;t need to spend so much time assembling data for promotion, awards, annual reports etc that are already report in one of the many systems but nobody is able to draw on these data for these awards/promotion files/annual reports/... including course assignments, grade distributions, and so on.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Pay non-tenure track instructors a wage commensurate to that of  other universities and provide a yearly increase without them having to jump through hoops.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Conduct meaningful post-tenure reviews to hold tenured faculty accountable for continuing to engage in research activities. We have way too many (ridiculously high paid!) duds around here. Also, since they have so much free time due to having no research agenda, they spend all that time thinking up ways to make other people miserable.  We have no recourse because it&#39;s not race or gender discrimination. Apparently, as long as you are horrid to EVERYONE rather than just to specific groups, you get a free pass. The university needs post-tenure accountability mechanisms.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Pay people. Pay adjuncts a fee that is not insulting. Teaching a 3 credit hour class is worth way more than [amount].  Not to mention we now expect adjuncts to teach online and they have to go through mandatory training that they don&#39;t get paid for!  Pay faculty members, especially new faculty members, a respectable wage. New faculty in my department are offered [amount] with no negotiation allowed--take it or leave it.  How are we supposed to attract the highest quality faculty with that?  I&#39;ve been here more than [number] years and that is only [amount] more than my starting salary.  Seriously, [amount] increase in starting pay in more than [number] years?!?! It is lip service to say we are trying to attract the best faculty. Paying a reasonable salary and recruiting high quality faculty would have a significant positive impact on my workplace.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">I would like to see [institution] encourage more hiring from within for tenure and administrative positions.  The university seems to put people into a box of whatever position they are hired into - regardless of what additional achievements or credentials they may obtain after their hire.  I was hired as a lecturer and, regardless of how many additional degrees, presentations, or publications I obtain, I will likely need to leave [institution] to obtain a tenure-track position.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">System for Lecturer level to participate in research - there is no hope of advancing career if there is no opportunity for research - the only opportunity we have is for teaching awards!</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Provide a transition for Faculty in Non-Tenure lines to be promoted or transition to Tenure lines.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">If you are going to act like a for-profit corporation, develop a system that rewards the productive, dedicated employee. The teaching loads for non-tenure track faculty are not conducive to having time to gather and collate all of the information required to get recognition. The [course evaluations] are subjective and unfair. I have years of high ratings and complimentary reviews and one semester with very detrimental reviews. This has held me back for applying for [teaching incentive] awards and promotion until it falls off the [number] year report period. In the years since those reviews the students have garnered enough negative faculty action to prove there was personal motivation in their reviews.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Sabbaticals should not be competitive and they should be available pre-tenure.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">More leadership and advancement opportunities for non-tenure earning faculty.  Most (if not all) leadership opportunities require full professor tenured status.  There is limited advancement for non-tenure earning faculty wanting to pursue administrative roles at this institution.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Fair salaries and not holding faculty back when they have achieved the tenure or promotion criteria.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">At this point, my institution needs to support faculty who have been impacted by covid.  The daycare on campus still is only open from 9-3:30.  That is UNTENABLE, faculty students and staff need full time child care.  Those of us with young children and aging parents that we care for have been more impacted than others.  You should implement course and/or service releases that people can apply for to get back on track. You should offer research refresh grants to help people get back on track.  You could offer grants to help faculty with child or dependent care. I am begging you to do some of these things, especially open the [childcare center] to its full pre-covid hours (we still pay the same price for 4-5 hours less of care by the way).  Especially women faculty have been impacted by this, if you want inequality persisting for years after this, that is what you are looking at if you do nothing.  Please help.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">I think the [institution] faculty could be more supportive of visible and non-visible disabled faculty and students.  I am not given a fair promotion process, my main concern is the continuing belief that disabled students need to &#34;report&#34; to faculty to receive their accommodations, this is wholly unfair this is the largest minority in the United States and they are not given equal access.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">I would like to see a complete overhaul in the &#34;non-tenure&#34; track faculty approach.  First, that name, &#34;non-tenure&#34; track faculty is borderline disrespectful because it focuses on what we don&#39;t have or what we are not rather than who we are and what we do have. That is tremendous strength often in practice and teaching methodology.  Second, there is not a lot of mentoring directly in our department space for non-tenure track faculty. We receive much of our formal mentorship opportunity through our university faculty and teaching center (thank goodness for them--they are great) and our group of non-tenure track faculty within the department have taken it upon ourselves to meet together periodically so we can talk about our opportunities and challenges. But there is not a formal mentorship process that I have been a part of at the department or even college level.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Taking a look at the full picture of what the job is like for the lower paid contingent faculty and those of us on 1-year contracts (who are the folks who also carry the heaviest teaching load). Constantly changing schedules, summer assignments being like a game with unknown rules, paying for our own parking and then having to fight for parking, no official rules/guidance on how departments should handle family obligations so it&#39;s all up to how a department chair feels about children/families, unrelenting pressure to perform and compete for things like awards to increase salary, etc. It&#39;s a pressure cooker, and yet, we also are reminded how thankful we should be that we get to be in this situation since SO MANY people would love to be where we are (which keeps many of us from speaking out).</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">I would like to see [institution] make more effort to retain female faculty. We have lost a number of excellent female faculty members due to a variety of reasons: sexual harassment, undervaluing/underpaying female faculty, a lack of equity between male and female faculty, and it is harder for female faculty to be promoted at [institution].</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Recognize the role of instructor as the backbone of the teaching duties at the university and taking advantage of the instructor&#39;s strength. Not giving recognition with awards for less effective teaching to people who are on a tenure track so that it &#34;looks good&#34;. Not giving substandards faculty teaching opportunities just because they have PhD and taking them away from a more qualified instructor.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Improvement is needed in equity of work-load across faculty. There is a strong bias to overload people who have high work-ethic, quality of work to receive more work than those who do not perform as well. There is also a bias toward tenured faculty as untouchable, regardless of ethical behavior.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Clarity in the tenure process and requirements. Specific requirements that departments hold for tenure-earners so that they can know precisely what to do and how they stack up. More flexibility with teaching to avoid burnout and allow significant research time. More base pay to support the ability to research.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Provide support to non-tenure faculty and implement a program to facilitate becoming a tenured faculty.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">find ways to address subpar performance by tenured faculty</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Administration has a long history of not being transparent and engaging in shared governance, and that was expected to change in the past year with a new admin, but decisions made with respect to remote work and the pandemic have not seemed in line with that expectation.  Lecturers (non tenure-track lines) receive no mentoring, little support, have no ability to negotiate raises (likelihood of receiving outside offers is next to nil when they are not conducting research actively)</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">There should be programs in place to assist non-faculty spouses in finding employment both at my institution and in the local area.  I lost out on an opportunity to be put on the tenure track due to a spousal hire in my Department, but my non-academic spouse can&#39;t get support for employment at [institution] even in an administrative or support capacity.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Mentor associate faculty toward promotion</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Faculty salaries, esp. for non-tenure earning faculty, continue to lag behind peer institutions. The university has a drive to constantly innovate and push forward new initiatives—which leads to both an attractive sense of possibility that gets many faculty excited to work here, but also potential feelings of burnout over time. Recognizing via compensation the work teaching-focused faculty do to keep the university moving forward and promote student success would go a long way towards helping NTE faculty be successful here. Promotion for NTE faculty is valuable, but base salaries still lag significantly, especially for faculty who have been here for longer. Tying salary increases almost exclusively to competitive processes like [teaching awards] (that reward individual effort) seems to perhaps work against the sort of collaboration the university seeks to promote, especially interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">I think the number one thing that my University could do to improve working conditions would be to change the bonus system currently in place. The primary bonus system is called [name] and it is a system that I feel unfairly awards individuals based upon who you&#39;re friends with on the award committee as opposed to actual hard work. It is very difficult in that many department&#39;s are understaffed and as such have classes and teaching loads that are quite larger then in previous years. These teachers are unable to do creative and unique activities because of the number of students they have. However our bonus structure is based on recognizing these activities. When faculty do not have the ability to engage in the same creative aspects that other department&#39;s do with smaller student populations, it fundamentally makes this system unfair.   The second change I would recommend is better treatment for non tenure track faculty. These individuals are known as either lecturers or instructors at our University and are the backbone of teaching students. However administration and leadership at our institution devalue their worth by not allowing them to serve on committees that only tenure track individuals can serve. There is also higher pay for these individuals than non tenure tract faculty. In the past there was a thought of changing the name of these individuals to teaching professors but tenure track faculty fought this very hard because they did not want to share the title of professor with individuals who &#34;just teach&#34; and do not do research. The primary purpose of the University is to educate students. These individuals are the ones who are teaching large class loads and getting in credit hours to enable professors to do research. They are extremely undervalued and there should be an effort to recognize there accomplishments in contributions.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">[Institution] is an excellent place to work for its fairness, clarity, and non-discrimination environment. The salary and other benefits are acceptable. However, as a Lecturer, I have the following severe issues:  - Teacher and student ratio is insane when taking 4+3 courses in two semesters. It turns out that in a semester a teacher might need to deal with 800 to 1000 students. Also, if a course has labs, it can become 32 different sections to manage by the teacher in a particular semester. Thanks to [institution] for providing grading and TA supports, however, the teacher also needs to manage this large group for proper task assignment, monitoring, rubric preparation, etc. The number of loads makes it difficult for me to balance my life and health, some semesters I lost weight a lot to deal with the semester&#39;s loads.  As a lecturer, 4+3 is perfectly fine for me if the teacher to student ratio is decreased significantly. More students mean more issues and a lot more emails and overall lot more things to manage. Also, it becomes difficult to give good feedback to students, difficult to understand the class status and individual student&#39;s status, and at the end, it might badly affect the student&#39;s performance as well as student evaluation to the teacher.   [Institution] and especially my department should strongly consider this issue which significantly affects the life of the lecturers.  My strong suggestion would be to reduce the teacher/student ratio. Maybe when the number of students in a course is more than 100 or other thresholds, then count every 100 students as a single course in the teaching load count.  Also, if a course has a lab, it should be also considered in the teaching load assignment with some different policy. Otherwise, it will be unfair to the teacher who is teaching courses with labs compared to the teacher who does not have labs.  For example, teacher1 is taking 4 courses without any labs and he has total of 4x80 = 320 students. On the other hand, teacher2 is taking 4 courses with all labs. He has total 4 x 250 = 1000 students with 32 sections including labs. This type of distribution is completely unfair. For teacher2, the number of courses must be decreased to make it relatively fair.  - The differences between the salaries of the non-tenure track faculty (Lecturer) and tenure track faculty are extremely high. It is understandable they have a research load, however, they have also a very low teaching load.  The salary differences look very unfair.  - With such a teaching load with so many students to a lecturer, the salary needs to be significantly increased. A faculty can earn the same amount with a significantly low student load in another place. So, it should be considered to retain the faculty. I know my friends who are Assistant professors/Lecturers at other universities. They have low research pressure, and also a small teaching load with only a few students per class. They are earning much more than me. Overall, people in other places might have a similar course load like us, but with a very small class size. However, they earn more than us which is very discouraging. I hope [institution] will consider this pressure on the teachers and adjust salary accordingly.  Thanks for the opportunity to express my thought.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Make it clear to tenured faculty not to pile work on tenure track faculty because it &#34;will look good for their tenure package&#34;.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">The one thing I think that would help is to continue to recognize the value of non-tenure earning (NTE) faculty. [Institution] is better than some other institutions when it comes to this, but there is still what I feel an &#34;outdated&#34; view of NTE faculty. For example, we are the only group to be classified by &#34;what we are not.&#34; I believe there is great value in teaching, and there is also research done on teaching and learning. Recognizing this value as equal to someone pulling in grants and other research I think would be a great step in the right direction.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Create parity between non-tenure earning faculty and tenure earning faculty. In my college it appears TE faculty easily earn promotion and tenure where they would fail at other institutions and NTE faculty are paid substantially less ([percent] in my case for a TE faculty hired [time period] after me with less experience) and expected to do more.</span></li>
