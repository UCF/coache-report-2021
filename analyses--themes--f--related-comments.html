      <p class=""><span>The final question in the COACHE survey asks faculty to describe the one thing your institution can do to improve the workplace for faculty. COACHE analysts assigned all responses to one or more common themes. The following are responses found to be related to this theme.</span>
      </p>
    </div><!-- end .head -->

    <div class="body">
      <div class="list">
        <ul>

            <li><span class="comments">I don&#39;t know about the &#34;number one&#34; thing. But one thing that comes immediately to mind is that we need the institution needs to develop more clarity around faculty governance. In a case in which I was on a search committee, it was clear that a department faculty preferred an external candidate but the Dean did not.  So, the Dean (as the hiring official) made the offer to the internal candidate. This occurs because the hiring official has decision-making power rather than a voting body. But it&#39;s evidence of the kind of nominal involvement faculty feel like they have in this process and others -- the faculty were involved in the everyday labor of the search: reviewing applications, interviewing candidates, conducting the campus visit, but ultimately the decision was in the hands of the Dean who seemed to have made up their mind in advance. Internal hires seem more prevalent here than anywhere else I&#39;ve worked, and I&#39;m not always sure that external candidates are actually considered for open positions. We have had several searches (faculty and administrative) in which internal candidates are hired and our college continues to hire graduates from it&#39;s own PhD program rather than diversifying its faculty with expertise and experience from beyond our institution.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Change the structure for deciding teaching loads. Do not allow this to be decided by mid level supervisors or coordinators. Provide more shared governance with regard to teaching assignments by not only asking what faculty want to teach, but by also respecting those wishes or at least providing solid rationale when they are not respected.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I think procedures/protocols/policies often change so quickly here at [institution] , which is also a positive to be so nimble and entrepreneurial .. But often the faculty voice is not solicited or really included.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Overhaul its senior leadership. Commit to transparency and shared governance (and not just lip service to these). Provide more oversight of those in leadership roles so that toxic work environments and rock-bottom morale can be addressed proactively.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">create formalized mentorship opportunities for non-tenure track faculty  create formalized but anonymous opportunities for faculty/staff to provide feedback on dept chair work style, leadership style, etc.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Leadership with more backbone to stand beside and support their faculty when they need it (rather than a persistent &#39;keep the peace&#39; mentality).</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Equitable salaries, especially for faculty who have been at [institution] for a longer time - the issues of salary compression and salary inversion are real and they lead to animosity and competition in the work environment. The second issue is the top-down model of decision making, especially among people like [redacted] who create discriminatory policies with no research or justification. Rather than address faculty who might be problematic, we have a sweeping policy created that discriminates against married people in an institution that tries to portray itself as family-friendly by having marital hiring opportunities.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">My biggest complaint is how COVID was handled. Faculty were shocked that decisions were made based entirely on political force and lacked any emphasis on pedagogy or faculty safety. It was also shocking the administration sent a survey to students, but not faculty, about return to campus preferences. Luckily, the Faculty Senate stepped up in that regard.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Administration should respect faculty decisions regarding program design &amp; content as well as student policies.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">To better evaluate the people they put in leadership positions to ensure that they are in fact effective leaders and prevent any one person from having too much negative impact on individuals or a department, need to hear faculty voices and department voices and actually make a concerted effort to make progress. For one individual to create so many challenges and issues with an entire department is unacceptable.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">[Institution] administration needs to show faculty with actions that they recognize that faculty are the reason [institution] is as good as it is, and that if we&#39;re going to become an R1, then faculty are the ones to do it. So we need [institution]&#39;s support to make that happen. E.g., [institution] could try to: get the amount of bureaucractic nonsense that flows to department chairs and to faculty under control, bargain in good faith with our faculty union, provide adequate grant support for research-active faculty, institute more policies that help our work-life balance, etc.  I feel like the top levels at [institution] (president, provost, VP for research) would agree with all of this, but sometimes I feel like that other levels of administration aren&#39;t yet onboard.  More generally, [institution] needs to keep fighting back against the pressure from the state/BOG to convert us into a technical college full of gig adjuncts teaching 5-5. Yes there are difficult issues in being an enormous university and being subject to the whim of state funding and state regulations, and there&#39;s no doubt that everyone here is working hard, but somehow we have to step back, assess, and do better for our faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">This University is too top-down. Many decisions are made at the top without respect for faculty. For example, teaching face to face without a vaccine during covid times, and not allowing for much faculty flexibility.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">There are so many things that need changing. We could start with getting rid of the paternalism of upper administration towards faculty and staff, and lower level administrators. Every email drips of condescension, both patting us on the head for doing a good job while increasingly moving real decisions into back rooms, away from any real input. There are many more things, very specific things that need changing, but they never will change. Those who make the highest salaries are happy with things as they are, and anyone who complains is just a whiner.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">respect faculty members by listening to them. They have great knowledge to help [institution] make better decisions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Less attention to the Board of Trustees and  hiring non-corrupt administrators - we haven&#39;t seen much from our new President yet...</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">There needs to be fewer fiefdoms. I have said this over and over. Yet nothing is done. Follow published standards across the board without exception.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Administration has a long history of not being transparent and engaging in shared governance, and that was expected to change in the past year with a new admin, but decisions made with respect to remote work and the pandemic have not seemed in line with that expectation.  Lecturers (non tenure-track lines) receive no mentoring, little support, have no ability to negotiate raises (likelihood of receiving outside offers is next to nil when they are not conducting research actively)</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">A sincere effort from the leadership at the University level to really listen and work closely with the faculty to solve larger as well as day-to-day issues to improve research and teaching at this great institution.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">[Home university] tends to default to a media-driven approach to patting itself on the back - stop pretending you&#39;re [an ivy league institution], when you have a community college mindset.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Transparency from leadership and trusting the units in terms of not telling them what leadership &#34;thinks&#34; they do (or what they believe is best for them). The downtown campus has destroyed our college and upper administration had an agenda that they tried to push despite strong objections from several units.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">If asked a few years ago I would say to not build a new downtown campus, but of course it was built and it negatively impacted my and my colleagues workplace. I used to enjoy going to campus - I considered it my second home. Not anymore.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Treat the faculty union with respect and communicate with them honestly.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Opportunity for salary negotiations and increases commensurate with actual earning potential outside of academics.  Transparency and consistency with teaching assignments. Equitable teaching loads. Increase faculty numbers to improve teaching load. In FTE assignments, numbers somehow always end up at 1.0...  sometimes course FTE shifts to help get there.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Faculty have little input in the administrative process. Disciplinary system is arbitrary and blatantly favors administration. Faculty union is &#39;tolerated&#39; but faculty input in administration is not seriously encouraged. Administrators can target individual faculty and engage in disciplinary actions knowing that the grievance process really does not treat faculty fairly.</span></li>
