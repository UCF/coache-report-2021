              <li class=""><span>I dont recall replying that</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Mandating face to face lectures for smaller classes and not following CDC guidelines.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The institution did a great job in responding to COVID-19.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>From my perspective, upper administration seems quite reluctant to communicate its rationale for any of the decisions it has made regarding its response to COVID. The decisions get communicated, but the process for making those decisions, the data that those decisions were based on, etc., simply aren&#39;t forthcoming. That;&#39;s pretty frustrating, and pretty demoralizing as well.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I&#39;m worried that faculty with legitimate worries about their chances of covid exposure weren&#39;t granted the option of teaching remotely. It&#39;s kind of a theme that has come up in other contexts; [home institution] agrees to something (e.g. parental leave) but then the implementation doesn&#39;t go the way the faculty expected it would, because of administrators either not understanding the parameters or actively flouting them.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>All [home institution&#39;s state] institutions had restrictions and mandates that came down from State government regarding returning to in-person classes. Many faculty were upset that they had to return to F2F instruction and blamed the shared governance structure, but that is not entirely fair when State government in some ways restricted [home institution] in being able to respond in a way that would have pleased most faculty. Beyond things that were mandated by the State, I think [home institution] did an exemplary job in following scientific research to prevent transmission and the shared governance structure worked well.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I am not informed enough to answer this question. I do know many care.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The Faculty Senate and its Steering Committee each met three times in the summer, when normally they do not meet.  They established two special COVID committees, on Health and Safety, and on Budget and Labor.  The administration asked for, and the Senate leadership provided, over 20 faculty appointments to COVID-related committees of the administration.  The Senate Chair met with the President and the Provost monthly in separate meetings.  While the order to go back into the classroom came from the Governor&#39;s office in an unaccountable, back-channel way, the President and Provost did what they could to keep faculty safe, and it worked.  With now over 500,000 student visits to classrooms, our contact-tracing program has not traced a single case to classroom transmission.  The Senate Chair called on the President to develop shutdown criteria, which he first resisted, but then did develop in the Fall.  The Faculty Senate requested modifications to the form faculty could use to get excused from teaching for medical reasons, and the administration granted several of the requested modifications.  The President and Provost held open forums early in the pandemic and have reported every month at the livestreamed Faculty Senate meetings.  They have taken and given straight and honest answers to difficult questions, often following up with individual faculty later.  I am very satisfied with the new administration&#39;s engagement with faculty on all topics, across the board, especially COVID.  Even though our return to the classroom was dictated from the governor&#39;s office, how it was done, both in the procedures in classrooms and the staged number of classes, was  remarkably favorable to faculty and entirely responsive to the voluminous input received, through a variety of channels.  These included two Senate-run surveys of all faculty, surveys run by student government, feedback in Senate meetings, discussions with the Senate chair, and feedback through the many COVID-related committees.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>participatory approach to developing operating procedures for return to in-person instruction and research</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Support for international faculty regarding academic freedom; need to better represent cluster hired faculty and jointly appointed faculty as a group with additional burden and low representation; proactive search to improve academic equity and support faculty retention (needs survey); seek an universal onboarding norm for faculty success with course release option</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Testing was an issue early on.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I answered &#39;somewhat disagree&#39; to how shared governance holds up under unusual situations for a reason other than my institution&#39;s response to Covid-19.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I do not believe administration listened to faculty regarding our challenges with assessments and cheating during the pandemic.  Maintaining high standards and excellence was near to impossible.  At some point, we need to return to having academic standards. For example - student attendance. We are NOT supposed to take attendance or require student attendance during the pandemic. However, some students took this to mean attendance was voluntary. And then, after never showing up to class &amp; failing a course, the student would blame the instruction. Students should understand that grace will be given, but attendance is required for success. This was not clearly expressed by administration.  Pass / Fail courses during Spring 2020 - in the early days of the pandemic. Allowing students to choose P/F up to the final exam was not a good choice. Students who should have dropped the class before the pandemic started, stayed through the final exam. And, after failure, those students blamed the faculty for their failure.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[State of Home Institution] is a hot zone for Covid, but it seems like getting teachers back in the classroom with no vaccinations is more of a priority then our health is. Students also want online classes; only a small percentage are saying they want face to face. The messages we get from Admin, though, are the opposite of what students tell us.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Decision-making has been centralized at the University level, which may be appropriate during a pandemic.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty aren’t listened to.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I just don&#39;t think our faculty work together very well to get things accomplished</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Covid response makes no sense. A lot of money was wasted in coming back to face to face classes prematurely, when students are not really interested (I have less than 2% of my students physically coming to class regularly). And at the same time putting faculty health at risk unnecessarily.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The leadership in my college has been very responsive to faculty concerns about Covid policies &amp; face-to-face teaching.  I feel the union has worked hard to gain faculty input to present to administration</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There is no shared governance, just the appearance of it. All decisions are already made before there is consultation, and the consultation is generally through forms like this COACHE form, which operationalizes data at the expense of finding out about any real problems. As for COVID, there are regular communiques that say little or nothing. We hear that faculty and students are going to get vaccines, and then there’s nothing more about that. A huge deal is made out of how hard students have it through all this, and faculty are expected to provide multiple modalities of teaching with minimal support. I don’t know who is doing all this well, but we aren’t. It is a hard thing to navigate these uncertainties, and I am willing to factor that in, but the superficial, patronizing communication has to stop. And the assumption of trust on the part of faculty and staff by administrators needs to come with some attempt to actually earn that trust. I see none.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>the university and the faculty union collaborated effectively in managing COVID 19 issues and communicated outcomes to the faculty.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I do not think the institution fully understands the subtle differences between clinical and other faculty&#39;s needs regarding COVID-19.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>They took all CDC precautions into account and allowed all faculty and students to teach and work from home. they provided vaccines as well.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There was overwhelming pressure from the [home institution&#39;s state government] to hold as many face-to-face classes as possible.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Administration regularly takes opportunities to sideline the faculty union and not work with them in good faith.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>N/A</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The administrators do not listen to faculty members when they make decisions.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I think the university should go farther than tenure clock extensions, which actually exacerbates the inequities between women faculty and faculty of color, considering things like salary.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>In contrast to the recommendation by the CDC, my university did not allow 65+ year old faculty members to teach online in Spring 2021</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There was no shared governance with regard to Covid-19 regulations.  And, when decisions were made, the communication about them was delayed and not transparent.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The pressure to increase on-campus classes seems to have come from the legislature and not the students. But it was presented to the faculty as a thing students were demanding. Faculty pushed back and were ignored. And half (or more) of our students aren’t even coming to the on-campus classes. That said, the union and administration did have conversations about responsibilities last summer that seemed fruitful. But overall, [home university] is a very top-down institution and will remain so until there are realistic options for faculty to engage in governance in ways that don’t suck up all their personal time.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The faculty union is important. However, they don&#39;t always represent the interests of the faculty, in my view, as they have actively attempted to reduce the number of awards such as [excellence in teaching and research award]. The union competes with the Senate for input during unusual times and is not always effective.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>very pleased that firings/layoffs have been minimal during COVID; but not pleased with pressure to teach in person classes</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>We simply don&#39;t have shared governance here. The faculty senate is structured as an advisory body to the provost. The union has limited power because of [home institution&#39;s] right to work laws. There is no indication that administration wants shared governance. There is no incentive for them to pursue shared governance in a meaningful way. Both the president and interim provost have admitted they were wrong in the early stages of the COVID response. They were unwilling to listen to faculty.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Our union president emails us a lot, but besides negotiating a one-time $[REDACTED] bonus for us, they were not able to secure PPE, work from home, or other significant protections for faculty during the pandemic.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I don&#39;t really know</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>We were forced to return to campus teaching and as far as I know that was determined by the board of governers, not the faculty senate. Most faculty I know did not want to return to campus, and most importantly, they did not think it was necessary.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The institutional leadership (e.g., provost, [governing board]) had terrible expectations concerning COVID, such as increased face-to-face teaching when the pandemic was at its worst. It took complaints and push back from union and non-union faculty. In the end, the situation was mostly worked out, e.g., faculty who did not want to teach on campus could apply to opt out. This is a debate that should not have happened in the first place if the institutional leadership were concerned with faculty and student safety first.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Home university] did better than in most other situations. Its risk-averse approach benefited here. The problem with decisions related to kowtowing to the governor. When that happened, it was clearly nonsense. We met with the Provost about the demand to have a doctor&#39;s note to teach remotely in late 2020. Here, we got some run around about how the decision came from high student demand for f2f classes. Several faculty asked for the data. There was none. Online classes in spring 2021 are bursting, f2f are small. [Home university] could have handled this honestly, but it did not. But, overall, [home university] has handled COVID well- when the state has not tried to interfere.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I felt forced into teaching in person. The criteria listed for exemption were not the complete list of risk factors offered by the CDC. I feel like [home institution] bowed to politics and lack of science by bringing students back on campus.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>We follow a corporate structure starting with appointed Trustees who control the agenda - there is precious little faculty involvement in much of the planning or goal setting.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The university, and college of medicine in particular, did not lead the community in this issue. We let the state and local officials set the bar. Not a great example.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>We had little say in whether we wanted to work remotely this semester. I was told I couldn&#39;t offer [hybrid] classes anymore, even though this worked really well in the fall semester. Everything came to us top-down, from admin, without faculty input.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>An inter-departmental Council should have been constituted with the Provost to determine an effective response to the COVID-19 situation, and situate Faculty needs in the period.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Our institution has forced many more faculty back into face-to-face classrooms than necessary due to the pressures of our Trumpist governor. I can&#39;t say they had much choice, but they have certainly not listened to faculty, and they have interpreted the CDC&#39;s guidelines in extremely narrow ways. Our Faculty Senate&#39;s questions have been mostly ignored, and the standards set for fully online teaching have been constantly moved to allow them to demand face-to-face teaching.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Vaccines given by Governor were applied not in a good way.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The administration does whatever they want and pretends faculty and students want it. I would have much more respect if they admitted they were under pressure from the state, but they don&#39;t.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>It seems like the administration is working with the faculty to allow flexibility for people to work at home due to the virus. I have been home for an entire year now. I do not like that they required every department to conduct a certain percentage of classes f2f this semester, though that requirement might have come from the state so it might not be fair to blame the university for that. I&#39;m not sure. The plan to be back to normal in the fall worries me. They are talking about holding regular classes and even sporting events. That seems like it might not be in line with science. We also don&#39;t know how that would impact faculty and staff&#39;s home lives, since many people might still feel uncomfortable sending their kids back to school. I hope the administration will continue being flexible until there is a COVID vaccine for children.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>A few people make the decisions.  Group recommendations are not taken seriously.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>All in attitude</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Very pragmatic steps were taken during this difficult time.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>We have been strong-armed in to teaching more classes back on campus. They are doing what they can in light of the pressure coming from the [Governing Board], but it is still unfair to push face to face on faculty, especially those with families.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>we&#39;ve neither shone nor had a catastrophe.  the biggest problem is actually pressure from the state rather than academic or institutional leadership</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I think they had to move fast. I think they had to satisfy the governor.  This was not compatible with real faculty governance BUT this is the real world and we have to live in it.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>no input from faculty was requested</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The university is running just fine, but the priority has been solely on satisfying the customer (student) without compassion for or consideration of the well-being of faculty and staff.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>My institution&#39;s response to COVID-19 is very satisfactory.  It gives faculty a choice for online or in-person teaching.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Home institution] did a fine job, but was well-prepared because of its resources for online teaching.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>It seems that the [collective bargaining agreement] is flexible and can be discarded when the University seems that it is necessary.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Something must have gone wrong before current President hire and challenges with budget.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Spring 21 semester there was a top down push for more in person classes despite the pandemic becoming worse than ever. Medical exemptions were allowed but using only a subset of CDC guidelines. The decisions and process leading to this was not transparent. Faculty feedback (i.e., disagreement) was minimized. There was no room for negotiation on this point. By the time it was announced, it was a done deal.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Despite rules regarding the use of CDC guidelines, faculty members who were reported as not following them were not reprimanded. Even those in semi leadership roles who were not following rules... they were allowed to continue on without any sanctions.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>As usual, I felt that there were forums for faculty and staff to express their opinions but at the end of the day, the upper administration made decisions (or possibly had already made decisions) that were not in alignment of what is majority. Too much pressure to go back into the classroom when the COVID numbers are soaring.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I don&#39;t know, I a not on senate and almost never hear from them and never invited to senate meetings ever.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I am super proud in general, of our institution, our students, and all the staff who have helped make this terrible situation safer and better. [Home institution] has provided great hand sanitizer stations, safety ambassadors, and smart, lovely PSA communications for all of us. I think our current semester, which had to be enacted mostly in person b/c of STATE threats to funding, is fairly ridiculous, given the rise in cases and deaths. The rollout to seek exemptions from teaching in person was particularly chaotic, confusing, and seemed to mostly work out for most people. I wondered if it were intentionally vague, giving the powers that be more leeway to approve. Doctors and health professionals were also very confused by the forms and the process. However, I am so thankful for the outcome and an avenue to protect my health by teaching virtually.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The Faculty Senate has no systematic way of communicating its agenda, priorities, or progress to the faculty, so many of us are generally unaware of their efforts. I was aware, though, that in spite of the Senate meeting the with Provost to express disagreement with new Spring policies requiring us to increase in-person classes, under pressure from the state of [home institution], the policies didn&#39;t change. Nor was there communication about the results of those meetings, from the senate or the administration.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Every time the faculty made suggestions about the pandemic, the university disregarded these suggestions to simply do what it wanted to do. Faculty don&#39;t feel comfortable teaching in a classroom, and can continue to teach online in Spring &#39;21 effectively? Who cares? The university wants to make its money off the cost of dorm living, so it needs the face-to-face classes to justify dorms, and so here I sit on campus, two days a week, lecturing through a mask, when I have already invested the labor for the past year in constructing web courses. Awesome.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>They have been very supportive in a state that the Governor has pushed to return faster than is healthy.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I think my organization made many very good decisions in response to COVID-19, but they didn&#39;t involve me in the process of making them.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I believe that our university pushed for in person classes before it was appropriate.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There has been a lot of confusion on the policies</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>We were asked for input, then decisions were made that went against this input.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Home Institution] was under pressure from the [State of home institution&#39;s Governing Board] to re-open. There was limited guidance given to faculty/administrators related to how to handle students&#39; unique situations in returning to campus (or choosing not to return).</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The university response has been disorganized, poorly implemented or not implemented in many respects, hurt students, staff, and faculty, and makes me personally feel unsafe. Our state government, which has behaved in terrifying ways during this pandemic, is accurately reflected by [Home Institution] lack of coherent response. The university should be ashamed.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There is no &#34;shared governance&#34; at this institution. [University administration] runs the show. And [university administration] is subject to the whims of the [governing board], the [governing board], and the legislature in [capital city in the state]. The increase in in person teaching in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021 is an example of Tallahassee not only holding the purse strings, but also pushing their ideologically driven agendas. When the Governor declared &#34;Covid is over&#34; in Summer 2020, everyone followed; regardless of the numbers and the science.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The administration’s approach to the pandemic has been one prolonged exercise in gaslighting faculty and staff. They have downplayed risks, misrepresented and underreported  cases, and made a great show of “hygiene theater” rather than addressing actual risks (airborne transmission). The university has promoted online learning for DECADES but suddenly discovered the essential benefits of the “in-person student experience” when the state government put pressure on universities to reopen.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There were aspects of the decision making process that was open and transparent, while others were not. With all the uncertainty at first, there was a lack of communication that led to frustration among faculty and staff.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The COVID situation is definitely an unusual one, and so it&#39;s hard to fault the university for its response. While efforts were made to engage faculty in decisions about Fall 20, that seemed to fade for Spring 21. The decisions for Spring 21 seemed much more arbitrary and based not on faculty input or real data so much as politics. That&#39;s understandable to a degree, but I wonder if faculty would be less dissatisfied if a different communication strategy and/or balance had been struck.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>the response was just OK, not great, but not bad.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I think many faculty taught to empty classrooms during the spring semester (as the vast majority of students logged on to zoom instead of coming to the class). It was silly to force face to face classes while cases surged and at the same time teach a blended class (some students in class, some at home). Either do full face to face or fully online. Blended was difficult and missed all the good parts of a face to face class---which faculty expressed to admin before the decision was made. I do not think that the administration listened to or responded adequately to faculty concerns regarding how this type of instruction would pan out. Additional, administration required faculty to disclose health information (or age) in order to get a exemption from teaching on campus. What if faculty did not want to disclose?</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I felt the faculty has been disregarded during the decisions made because of COVID 19. Faculty have taken on extra work--building online courses and learning different technology to teach--Zoom, smart classrooms, recording in person classes, etc.with no compensation or raise. I went back to the classroom this semester and not have a choice.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Home institution] administrators could have engaged in more dialogues with the faculty union and made the decision making process vis-s-vis COVID response more transparent than it did. It would have fostered good faith bargaining.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Typically the administration just makes decisions, and only reconsiders them if faculty push back hard. With COVID, faculty largely refused to teach in person in most cases to protect themselves and their students, and [home institution] did far better than other universities in not steamrolling over that. But it largely came down to facilities - with our huge number of students it wasn&#39;t possible to teach most classes in the rooms we have, so they went along with faculty demands. This wasn&#39;t because of the effectiveness &#34;shared governance&#34;, it was department chairs reporting to deans that the majority of faculty were simply not going to endanger themselves or their students, consequences be damned, and if the faculty were retaliated against, that would only harm [home institution] as a whole (e.g. firing faculty would create a death spiral with no one to teach classes).</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The COVID respond seems to be dictated by above, I&#39;ve never been asked my preferences and neither have my students been asked.  Firm decisions need to be made sooner so everyone can plan accordingly.  Having to constantly remain &#34;flexible&#34; is mentally exhausting.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Our institution did a good job in response to Covid-19. However, the worst decision I thought is we kept 2020 spring break active, that the time Covid-19 peak came.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Home Institution] needs to do more to assist students who do not have adequate laptops and high-speed Internet connections available where the student lives.  [Home Institution] has a large number of first generation students from low income households that don&#39;t have readily available access to the technology necessary to engage in online courses.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Administrators at my institution requested feedback from faculty via the Faculty Senate and Faculty Union but broadly rejected both entities&#39; recommendations regarding Covid-19.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The administration has been dismissive of faculty concerns about returning to on-campus teaching, in contrast to peer institutions outside [home institution&#39;s state].</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Home institution] decisions seem to be guided by state budgetary requirements.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I think my institution pivoted skillfully when the pandemic hit. Faculty were given the resources they needed to immediately convert face-to-face classes to remote modalities. And all of the prior training I received through our excellent [digital learning program] paid vast dividends! My teaching evaluations for students actually went UP after the pandemic hit, thanks to that training.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>In my view, faculty are no longer the respected backbone of the university (even though Administration constantly says it is).  The upper administration does what it wants, and informs faculty afterward.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The university uses &#34;unusual situations&#34; like COVID 19 to implement new policy under &#34;emergency powers&#34; that exploit faculty labor and disregard faculty rights and governance</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Expected level</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>NA</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The university is operating as if the pandemic is over.  Despite news reports that it clearly isn&#39;t, they are planning to go back to face to face classes with full capacity, no more distancing, and even talking about no longer requiring masks. They are not listening to the majority of faculty who do not feel safe to return to face to face. Instead of giving faculty a choice, they have made us to fill out exemption forms. And, the Provost even said in a recent email that he was concerned that faculty would decide to teach classes virtually because it is more convenient for them and that we would not take into account the needs of the student.  How insulting.  So, no.  The administration is not listening to the faculty.  I recognize that other universities are doing even worse, but that doesn&#39;t make what they are doing to us and our students any better.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The fact that the policing of mask compliance on campus has fallen to faculty is enormously frustrating. It&#39;s not a job I wanted but was, in essence, given by being required to teach F2F. All the time, students wear masks that don&#39;t properly fit and that fall under their noses. Some never bother to correct this issue until prompted. So, I&#39;m faced with either being forced into unsafe circumstances or constantly pause my lessons to prompt students.    We should&#39;ve been given boxes of disposable masks to hand out to students whose cloth masks don&#39;t properly fit. And many on campus, outside of the classroom, wear their masks on their chins and either show hostility when prompted to wear them (is it worth the effort to say, &#34;Armor up&#34;?) or quickly put them on because they were &#34;caught,&#34; which shows how they&#39;re not taking it seriously when faculty aren&#39;t watching. Again, further increasing risk.  Also, many of our students did NOT feel safe coming to campus, and yet we were still forced to show up and teach 3-8 F2F students with the rest online. The University could&#39;ve been far more proactive about finding out which students wanted to be online and which wanted to be F2F in order to avoid these fractured teaching environments.   Finally, far too many students have been disengaged with their coursework this year, and there hasn&#39;t been enough academic advising support. If it weren&#39;t for Student Care Services, I&#39;m not sure what would&#39;ve happened to so many of my students who start slipping through the cracks.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Another example of top-down decision making. The decision was made to require courses on campus this spring because there was demand for them by undergraduates, but many of the courses that came to be required, based on their size, were graduate courses. Graduate students in our department did not want to come to campus but they were required to based on the university&#39;s top-down decision.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>NA</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Home Institution] has been all over the place with regard to COVID.  [Home Institution] deemed it utterly unsafe to be on campus March-Dec of 2020 but perfectly safe to force everyone back in Jan or 2021.  Based on medical science and the status of COVID spreads, neither students nor faculty felt it was safe to be in on-campus classes in spring of 2021, but [Home Institution] forced it anyway.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>It was incredibly stressful to receive approval for virtual teaching due to health reasons and the pathways/process was completely unclear until the last possible minute, which caused a great deal of uncertainty about teaching modality for myself and my students. Communication could have been improved upon with more transparency throughout the pandemic, but also with respect to being more proactive than reactive or, worse, taking the &#34;wait and see&#34; approach. It seemed like [home institution] did not care about my safety as a faculty member as much as they cared about the students because students were given CHOICE as to whether they returned to take classes on campus immediately or continued to learn virtually - faculty should have had this same opportunity and have been valued as much by the institution as our students were in this situation.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The decisions about returning to campus were made completely by the administration without any consultation with the faculty at large. Yet another example of how shared governance doesn&#39;t happen at [home institution].</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The &#39;forced&#39; migration back into fsce-to-face teaching mode when we are still at high levels of infection rates, only 10 of 75 students show up on most days, and the lack of support when your children need to stay home because their school has been placed in quarantine. We were also told to be flexible with students at this time but there was no flexibility put in place for faculty - be in the classroom at risk for COVID when it was not necessary, or pay the consequences in your employment.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>They have been in a rush to reopen the campus even though many students and faculty feel unsafe in doing so. They have denied many requests for online assignments from faculty.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Timely response to switch to remote mode of teaching and working.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There is clear outreach to faculty leaders, and all faculty members, as decisions were and are made about COVID-19 response.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The governor insisted on forcing [home institution] faculty to return to classrooms. Also, [home institution] has had to deal with a slew of terrible decisions and statements by the Trump administration. It rarely pushes back and when it does so, it hedges.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Home institution]&#39;s COVID response has been better than other universities.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There was no coherent messaging and decision making across all levels of upper administration or other shared governance entities. Messaging about decision making conflicted across leadership, it was slow to respond and leadership did not appreciate the impact that COVID had on those below them--even though they kept saying on a weekly basis that they did. Actions speak louder than words when people are in crisis.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I think the university has responded well to COVID-19.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>That is a legacy of being a state university where Faculty Senate is a toothless body and administrators are held accountable not necessarily by the faculty but by politicians in the state capitol. So, that is more of a structural issue than an indicator of leadership failure.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Home institution] needs to make decisions about remote teaching in advance! It is unacceptable that faculty knows last minute and cannot answer emails from students regarding their modality of teaching. In addition, [home institution] does not care if faculty does not feel comfortable teaching face to face or are at risk. They are pushing for in-person classes because the governor of [home institution&#39;s state] says so! They care more about the money than safety!</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Focus was on bargaining and faculty needs rather than supporting students</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I understand the university&#39;s quandary because of the governor&#39;s decrees, but feel that instructors (and not just at [home institution]) were not listened to with the back to campus push. Our lack of power in the situation was pretty clear.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Administration is cowed by the shiney shoes and pointy heads in the General Counsels office for whom teaching is an abstraction and the top priority is not getting sued.  The faculty “union” has unreasonable demands that are designed to protect the most mediocre of faculty at the expense of the top performers.  Neither have a clue what it going on in the trenches of the classroom every day.    The administration feigns interest in faculty opinion, then roundly ignores it when received and does what the lawyers tell them to anyway.  We all know that these focus groups are purely showpieces and that the decisions have already been made.    The “union” pounds its chest about “solidarity” and then pursues unreasonable demands that have far less to do with broader faculty concerns and are primarily focused on advancing their political agenda or protecting inept faculty members from any consequences.    Those of us who do the teaching, and do it well, are ignored.  A pox on both their houses.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>BOT doesn&#39;t seem to respect the faculty union. The administration is pushing in person classes when there is insufficient safety for the faculty.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Shared governance at [home institution] is a joke. The Faculty Senate has not been taken into consideration at all in any of the administration&#39;s decisions about COVID or anything else.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Decline to answer</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty are forced to teach face to face during COVID without being vaccinated.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Have no idea what to say here</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The provost inflicting the Governor&#39;s will is terrifying.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The decisions about covid are being made on main campus and have nothing to do with our unit which is off campus. Our campus has not used expert input and knowledgeable faculty to make decisions but used the people who talk a lot and want to be popular. They have repeatedly set guidelines which they do not then follow and they have not sought input from all faculty on those guidelines. The process is not discussed in a &#39;safe&#39; environment and instead is pushed through in large public meetings which include supervisors, students, staff, admin.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Administration caved to political pressure to have more classes on campus and did not give faculty the decision to teach remotely if they were concerned for their health.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Decisions made by Administration before faculty senate had the opportunity to weigh in on topics that greatly impacted them.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty had very little input, and when input opportunity was provided, then that input was belittled.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The union is ineffective, slow, and regularly late in completing negotiations that do not provide equal benefits. Increases should come as a percentage, not as a flat rate. Increases should be based on merit, and occur to the base salary, not as one-time payments. The institution responded to Covid-19, and the union complained afterward.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>My responses are based on current (interim) leadership; the University as a whole encouraged leadership/interim directors/department chairs to promote compassion and flexibility; however, this did not happen in our department under current interim leadership.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The precautions taken from Covid 19 are over the top. It&#39;s not fake news, but it&#39;s impossible to teach and research effectively in my field right now. Not because of the virus, but because of the response to it.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Money over health.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>This institution has done an excellent job at communicating with faculty about issues involving safety and COVID-19, including the mandate to wear masks on campus and the requirement of a COVID checker prior to entering campus.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>We have decisions being made for us based on what our Board of Trustees demands, which is more in person classes. They need to let every faculty member make thier own decision. We are not cannon fodder, we are human beings. Students are given choices that faculty are not even allowed to have. I am immunocompromised from [previous health condition].I do not know if I will lose my job b/c even if I can finally get vaccine, my immune system is not working well enough.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Not much to say, covid was crazy for everyone, including administrators, I think everyone tried their best, and I generally just attempted to get through the things I needed to do and paid little attention to admin decisions unless it directly impacted me.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Complete flexibility and support was given. It remains so until now. One improvement could have been made to expand last summer&#39;s course designations. Student expectations were not met for those substituting synchronous teaching, instead of in-person classes.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>we were asked our preferred method of delivery and despite ranking remote as top, we are still expected to be in face to face format</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Response to COVID was strong in earlier months of pandemic. However, moving into spring semester there appeared to be different messaging than in prior summer/fall...especially related to childcare responsibilities of faculty and staff and in person teaching. When asking a question about how the university would be supporting parents in the spring semester...as parents made school decisions in august for virtual/homeschool/hybrid/f2f learning and could not easily change or feel comfortable changing given [home university&#39;s state] is a COVID mess...I was told by a Dean that if we couldn’t do our job we could find work elsewhere. This was not only a disgusting and disheartening response but was the antithesis of how parents were supported in prior months.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty were given broad academic freedom to adapt modality in the face of covid-19.  It remains to be seen whether we will be pushed back into a classroom against our wishes before the worst of the situation is over.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>We are all doing the best we can under very strange circumstances.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty and faculty senate had a very proactive and active involvement in COVID response.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The upper administration provided a lot of guidance and resources for departments, but they let departments make many decisions on their own, given individual circumstances.  We did not all have to respond to the difficulties in the same way, so this was very successful.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Roles have been set by administrators and shared government had no power to influence these roles significantly.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Using different channels of communications we were regularly updated with information about what the university intended to do during the pandemic was crucial and impressive. Top leadership is unquestionable. Little details of the job is the challenge.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The Provost and President were open to having frank and very frequent conversations with the faculty senate about COVID from the very early days of the pandemic until the most recent updates.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Decisions were made about how university would respond without consultation of all faculty. While limited representative faculty were involved on the various committees, they were identified by upper administration and subsequently shaped the university response.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Too much focus on face to face classes as opposed to the relative safety of teaching in a synchronous remote modality.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I was not personally adversely effected. But I have heard from colleagues that exemptions from teaching face-to-face were difficult to come by, the process seemed incomplete, confusing and rushed when they finally asked faculty members if they wanted to be exempted. The push to go back to face-to-face this spring is a misguided attempt to appease the Governor and the [home institution&#39;s state] state legislature.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>My biggest complaint is how COVID was handled. Faculty were shocked that decisions were made based entirely on political force and lacked any emphasis on pedagogy or faculty safety. It was also shocking the administration sent a survey to students, but not faculty, about return to campus preferences. Luckily, the Faculty Senate stepped up in that regard. The administration had meetings with faculty, but our feedback was not considered in the decision making. The meetings were more to reiterate that decisions had already been made and that faculty consent was not needed or wanted in order to proceed.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The response has been excellent, enforcing masks, providing a testing, and hopefully, a vaccination site</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty should have been respected and the university should have remained only online for at least one more semester. Changing Spring break for later without consulting faculty was not a respectful decision to make as well.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty assignment to rooms and not being able to make the choice to teach remotely without a doctor&#39;s note are two items that needed more shared decision making rather than top down decisions.  Decisions have been perceived by faculty as top down.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty were required to return to in person teaching with NO regard for home situations/home-family health.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>As I mentioned in my previous open-ended answer, my disappointment regarding COVID was not related to the choice faculty had to be or not on campus. Faculty was given the option to return or not in the fall, which I believe was positive. As one of the few who chose to go back to campus and teach an entire term in the fall, I was disappointed that doing so seemed to go almost unnoticed by the leadership.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Safety of faculty, staff, and students supported by research and facts has created a safe environment at [home institution] despite opposing beliefs from state-level elected leadership.  [Home Institution] is leading the way on living and working with COVID-19.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I think I did this in the last response, but faculty needs to be helped with getting back on track after this, especially women.  I really appreciated the bonus, it helped, but it is not enough, there is a lot more that can be done.  Also, you should be lobbying to vaccinate us.  You say that covid does not spread in classrooms, but that is NOT true.  There have been no major outbreaks, but it can and does spread there, it just goes as &#34;unexplained&#34; transmission.  Also, you forced us back into the classroom when students did not want to go.  I was forced to have a face to face class that did not have sufficient enrollment and was cancelled.  Now I &#34;owe&#34; a class to my department in the future.  This is the height of unfairness!  In my effort to try to recover from this I will be saddled with more classes!  Please stop forcing us back so fast.  Students like the VR mode.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Our request to move our mixed mode classes to fully online for the spring semester got rejected. Therefore, many of us had to go back to the classrooms when we still do not feel comfortable.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Our faculty governing body was included in discussions about responding to Covid. However, their preferences were ignored when the state board of governors mandated increasing the number of classes offered face to face for Fall 2020. The leadership, both university administrative leadership and faculty leadership, did try to put as many protection and &#39;safe&#39; practices and features into place as possible. This was a difficult situation, with media hype, misinformation triggering panic among faculty and students. I&#39;m not sure having this decision requiring agreement from all parties would have been realistic as faculty are not aware of all the various implications, for example, of maintaining emergency remote teaching long term.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I have hated teaching from home.  All I get to deal with are dissatisfied students and at the enrollment levels of my class, it can be overwhelming.  All the random good interactions are gone.  I&#39;m not really teaching anymore.  I&#39;m just a traffic cop....</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>It was handled well initially but eventually, the administration began to pressure the faculty to return even though covid infection rates were on the rise.  It&#39;s frustrating but being told that your concerns aren&#39;t.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The administration wants to open up more F2F classes. Before COVID19, the same administration wanted to expand more online courses. ???</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>For the most part, such as the presence of Hurricanes/Tornados etc, the institution holds up well because of a clear and present danger of such events. However, the institution during COVID was influenced heavily due to political influence from the state and White House that meant that even when data was showing high levels of transmission in the community, there was a push from leadership to open up courses to be face to face rather than remote. Whilst our department felt the pressure of such influence from leadership, our chair was strong enough to resist them. I do not feel that the voices of faculty and staff were acknowledged beyond a compulsory fein of acknowledgement that senior leadership was &#34;listening&#34;. And therefore, were we actually listened to or was it only as a result of our department chair pushing back.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I suspect that our legislature exerted undue influence ondecision making about COVID policies.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>the response of the institution has been exemplary.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The Faculty Senate did not seem to be able to really change the university&#39;s bottom line against the [governing board].</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The collective bargaining group is a NIGHTMARE for tenure-earning faculty. They do NOT represent the majority and only push the agenda of the liberal minority. Our faculty need to get back to campus and teach our students. If they continue down this fear mongering road, I fear that [home institution] will have to lay-off professors, because students will go elsewhere to get their education face-to-face! THE UNION NEEDS TO GO!</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Decisions made grossly adversely affected the arts, but most decisions the university makes don&#39;t account for us- so it&#39;s not surprising.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>No</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Lack of clarity about course modes, for both students and faculty. Lack of clarity on decision making process. Lack of civility among faculty when differences of opinions are publicly addressed.  My needs were met regarding COVID 19 so far; not sure about the future.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>A biased approach for faculty expected to be on campus with face-to-face teaching assignments. It was not optional but required for some faculty. Into the Spring 2021 semester the pressure and lack of support was enforced for some faculty to be on campus. Campus &#34;clean&#34; classrooms approach was unequally approached and custodian staff OVER BURDENED to make up for lack of support.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>While contentious, the relationship between our faculty union, our faculty senate, and our upper administration came together to balance between state pressure to reopen, and university stakeholder focus on health and safety. While not perfect, it&#39;s better than it would have been without those shared governance checks-and-balances.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Frankly, the administration&#39;s response was a bunch of bullshit, even as I recognize much of the bullshit was pushed down on us by [Governor of State of home institution]. Safety should have been the first and only concern; it was not.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>My only comment about the Covid-19 response is that many students are not being careful when they are outside of the school setting. I and other colleagues have personally witnessed them without masks, in large groups around [home institution&#39;s city], so I feel all [home institution] faculty and staff should be given access to vaccines. I do realize that there are other factors that may prevent the availability of the vaccines.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The response is fine. I understand that there is not a lot the university can do as it must stand up to the Board of Regents and the state requirements, of which some may disagree with.  But I think they are doing the best that they can under the circumstances.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>we didn&#39;t have a plan, we were told to figre it out (Zoom etc) with little or no support/traing.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>our faculty union has been a strong advocate, faculty were assigned to various task forces, but it does not appear that our input was actually used in decision making.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty senate met extensively to address COVID issues. There were several recommendations made, but the administration faced with budgetary issues did not really take these issues into consideration.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I want us to be back to total normal!!</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Home university] is overall an excellent place to work and my department is outstanding. However, when the university makes major plans for shifting priorities it does not do a good job of taking faculty perspectives into account. The biggest case in point was the move to the downtown campus, which was made with little consideration of faculty concerns and needs. Although meetings and mechanisms were put into place to solicit faculty input, it was clear to everyone from near the beginning that our perspectives would not be heeded. And they were not.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Covid-19 was the event where I found the institution did the right thing and still does. I am in admiration for that effort.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There is perpetuated and unfounded fear about COVID. Panic has set in and until you force people back to the building, there will be a continued inertia that will take a very long time to recover from. Quit playing amateur epidemiologist and serve your students and your community by stepping up and getting back to work. If Publix and Walmart can, and have been doing it, then we can too!</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Shared governance is simply a tool for administration to say they provide faculty a voice in governance. Faculty do not really decide anything of importance.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Administrative decisions were and continue to be influenced by politics rather than science or compassion.  The committees put together to determine institutional policy had lots of administrators and few biologists, nurses, physicians, epidemiologists or others most knowledgeable about the virus and how to deter its spread on campus (and off, as our 70,000 students go to bars, go to work, go home to their families, etc).  Administration was more concerned with telling a (fictional) story about how [home university] had &#34;no cases of transmission&#34; than in being responsible to the campus community and metropolitan area that are intrinsically intertwined.  Hugely disappointing.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>new college seemed to continue with irresponsible decisions amidst a foreseeable budget crisis.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There was a lot of confusion in implementing the COVID plans initially. My own COVID tests were botched by [home university]; incorrectly billed and this is something that I am battling with the insurance company. Nonetheless, things have settled to a near normal now. The research infrastructure held up and while there has been productivity losses we are doing OK. One thing the Provost or VCR has to address is the delayed graduation of PhD students and how can these be covered by PIs whose funding may run out before the students graduate. This will snowball into a big problem if not tackled early on. Nobody is talking about these issues.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Not clear strategy at the beginning of the pandemic. Not clear strategy with the vaccination. Too much pressure to return.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty should have an option how to teach online or face-to-face.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I don&#39;t think it was taken seriously enough and that concerns were voiced to administrators several times. I am in several high-risk categories but was assigned to in-person small-group labs. Precautions were taken (face masks &amp; shields, etc...) but not enough such that I was comfortable. In addition, asked to be allowed to teach online only when it was possible (i.e. didactic lecture-based course). Also willing to do virtual patient visits from home and/or clinic, with minimal in-person patient visits. Was told that it was either all or none (teach everything in person with flex-blend or don&#39;t come to campus at all - to office, clinic, classrooms, college). Also told that all virtual clinical visits had to originate from campus. So, had to submit waiver for on-campus activity offered by [home institution] and not come to campus at all and no clinical practice.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I am not award of any involvement in dealing with COVID from shared governance entities. Decision were made through administration without much consolation with faculty.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I don&#39;t have a clear picture of what shared governance has actually occurred.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Very clear and meaningful policies about campus closure/semi-closure, face-mask requirements, online course implementation, and vaccination.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I just think that [home institution] did a very good job on communication and policies with regard to Covid. I believe that the Governor, however, has done an abysmal job and that occasionally seeps down in perceived policy but in the end [home institution] did extremely well.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I understand the university leadership felt pressure to hold in-person classes during Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, but I perceived that a very large number of faculty were uncomfortable with this situation and were asked to teach in person anyway, unless they had a medical or similarly stringent reason to teach remotely. I would have liked to see more deference or at least empathy with regard to the faculty perspective.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>how can I judge our admin in their making of such decisions in this culture of &#39;lack of truth&#39; (way too much noise)</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty were not consulted as [home institution&#39;s] COVID responses were developed.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I felt that there was tremendous pressure from the [State of home institution] [Governing Board] for faculty to return to the classroom, but I do not blame [home institution] administration for this.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty decisions about best mode of instruction were frequently overruled by administrative office without any reason given. Shared governance means communication and not allowing the size of an institution to minimize the collective communication.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The administration has worked quite well with the faculty senate to determine what to do during covid pandemic.  The problem appears to be the mandate from The governor that classes need to be in person, which is in direct contradiction to CDC and other guidelines.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I am not allowed to choose the teaching mode for my class.    Some of the items that faculty requested to facilitate f2f teaching, such as microphones to allow for clear lecturing through the mask, were not given to us.  Further, the administrators have chosen unreasonable rules.  For example, I have been told that if I get sick, I&#39;m not allowed to cancel the class and I&#39;m not allow to transition the class online while I recover.    Also, the administrators have failed to provide basic items to allow for safe teaching f2f.  This includes the lack of foot-based door pulls and broken disability access door activators that would allow for the door to be opened without touching the handle.  This also includes stacks of disinfecting wipes in the classroom that are so dried out, they are like dry paper towels.  Further, they appear to be trying to save money by reducing the ac/heat.  The temp inside the classroom tends to be close to the outside temp.  On some occasions, the combination of the cold and the mask make my eyeglasses so foggy, I can&#39;t even see through them while teaching.  I take them off and teach half-blind.  Aside from teaching, they transitioned us to work from home and then refused to give us the equipment needed to do so.  For example, some people didn&#39;t have scanners at home and then the university administrators sent us all required forms to complete that needed to be printed, signed, scanned, and returned to them.  Then, when people asked for printers/scanners at home, they told us these were unreasonable requests.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>What [home institution] did was create excessive amounts of tedious and irrelevant paperwork we had to complete to do the fundamental things to keep our research going. The forms continue to change constantly and require new paperwork just about every month. We were not included in the process for deciding what information was necessary or important. This has made an extremely stressful time even harder and i have not felt supported in my attempts to keep my research program going during COVID.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Shared governance did not hold up when the VP for the Graduate College did not follow the rules for putting policy into place. CoVid was not something that was a problem regarding how it was handled.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>x</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The criteria against which COVID has been managed has appeared to shift continuously. Sometimes I feel like student health and safety is the issue, but other times it seems to be about revenue and business management. It hasn&#39;t adequately balanced those two side of the discussions so that more balanced approaches were explored.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I think the university handled the COVID-19 situation as well as could be imagined under the circumstances, and was generally very open to feedback from faculty.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The return of face to face classes happened too quickly.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Sometimes the faculty senate passes resolutions after the president and provost have already reached decisions.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Very thorough but too laissez-faire and demanded too much of faculty and students to be on campus</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty were not provided a lot of input into the university&#39;s response to COVID-19.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Home institution] did a horrible job of shared governance during the COVID-19 pandemic. [Home institution] also did a terrible job of supporting faculty with resources to flip classes to online overnight and then the PROVOST insulted faculty claiming that students were complaining about the quality of online instruction during COVID. Yet, faculty did not receive support or release of time from research or service to ensure a quality educational experience. Additionally, [home institution] provided no resources to ensure that research efforts could be successful while trying to research remote.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I answered disagree here specifically because of Covid. While the administration did allow for faculty exemptions with those who were susceptible to getting Covid to teach online, for the sake of the students, staff, and faculty, the entire institution should have been online only, as was common to many institutions around the world. It was not safe for those of us forced to work in person.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>My union had a good response but the University&#39;s response was too slow and disorganized.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The main thing is that the university leadership continues to express that students want to return to classrooms, but they have furnished no data to support this. Also, the university seems to ignore data that faculty provide showing that many students DO NOT want to return to campus yet.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I&#39;ve attended &#34;open forums&#34; where there is opportunity to answer questions and consider faculty feedback, but nothing has been done despite a large number of those present opposing the university&#39;s position and approach.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Legitimate faculty input and feedback were ignored.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Na</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Our university leadership did not systematically solicit input from faculty, staff or students about preferences for institutional responses to COVID-19. Listening sessions and town halls are not the only thing that should be used. Anonymous surveys would have been appropriate. That those were not used to me implied that they did not want hard data that was counter to what they were already planning to do.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I simply don&#39;t buy into the overly dramatized panic to a rather innocuous, low-threat virus...</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The general counsel&#39;s office, who lives in fear of the University being sued and cares about little else, came to the conclusion that we must be remote and offer classes over Zoom to minimize lawsuit risk. The [state of home university] has demanded that the University teach as many in-person courses as possible, on an increasing schedule, before the University is (lawyers are) ready. This has put the University in the middle, with the leadership to scared or too unempowered to tell the state to take a hike and the lawyers too scared (and too powerful within the University) to return to normal. So, shocker, who does it devolve on to come through with shining colors to make sure the whole thing doesn&#39;t collapse? The faculty. Figure out how to transition to remote teaching on 3 days notice. Be amenable to assignments that have you teaching in person when you don&#39;t want to be. Figure out how to deal with students in your course who want to be on campus and others who want to be off campus at the same time. Simultaneously teach in person AND remotely. Innovate. Be creative. Solve this one for us. In return we will...give you nothing as usual.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There was a little concern about teaching face-to-face this semester. It seemed the cutoff date for changing modalities last fall for spring semester came up abruptly and limited options.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>With the exception of pausing the tenure clock for tenure track faculty, my institution made no other accommodations for pre-tenure faculty who were navigating COVID, especially those with dependent care responsibilities and partners/spouses deemed essential workers.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The response was very effective and positive!</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>we have been a very active faculty in working to make sure we were providing a safe environment for teaching in covid.  we had tons of faculty committees related to it. I really felt that we were doing our best to make it work.  I am proud of how we handled it</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There is not shared governance at [home university]. Although faculty governing bodies exist, we do a lot of work for very little consideration in decisions. [Home university] has a culture of top-down, strong-arm leadership. With regard to COVID, faculty who did not want to teach on campus and whose classes could be moved to online delivery should have been supported in making this decision for themselves. Many departments did their best to support faculty concerns, but many were required to offer certain quota of on-campus, face-to-face instruction forcing faculty to choose between their health, their families&#39; health, and their livelihoods. This should not have been an ultimatum.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I believe [home institution] did the best, under the circumstances.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The response to COVID-19 was OK. I was referring to the response to unusual situations more generally.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>In some decisions the university administration has given in to political pressures.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty should not have been asked to return to the classrooms against their will in Spring 2021. Their health and lives are endangered by this decision. I think school administrators bowed to political pressure and ignored science and the wellbeing of faculty they are supposed to represent and protect. Claims that no infections can be traced back to the classroom are at best naive. Tracing is not that accurate.  Demoralizing and heartbreaking decision. Not one we will forget.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Online course delivery is great; attention to preferences of professors and continued availability of Zoom are important; financial assistance was lacking</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Our tech support was FANTASTIC. I was impressed with how quickly the tech departments pivoted and how easily Zoom was implemented.   During the Fall 2020 semester, there was a push to return to on-campus classes in January. This push was clearly based on student demand rather than scientific reasoning...and the push was clearly not in the best interest of anyone&#39;s health. It was disconcerting that the opinions of students were prioritized over scientific evidence. Those decisions certainly did not make me feel valued (or cared for in the least).</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The school immediately went into on-line courses and teaching for all. The university had set up training for faculty and staff to work on-line. The university has also implemented a vaccine plan - beginning to have all over 65 year old faculty and staff be vaccinated. They plan to continue and open this up to the students  very soon.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Responses were global from the provost to all faculty and did not address an individual faculty&#39;s needs.  Our home college and department had to work through the university offices to communicate to faculty, which caused delays in disseminating information.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>It appears that, although the faculty voice was expressed, it was not heard by the administration during the decision-making process in relation to COVID-19. The administration only seems to listen to the state government.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>There was very little concern for faculty in decision making - faculty were told what to do and told they had no choice BUT that they had to accommodate students who wanted something different.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>I thought our chair handled things really well. Up from there it was really clunky and many poor decisions (that were so easy to see in advance would lead to suboptimal outcomes) were made.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>To be honest, this was a situation where department leaders and faculty were left to fend for themselves and figure things out. Cannot think of any one department that was effective in managing this crisis, except for IT that provided consistent and useful assistance for all to adapt to new technology during pandemic. They were also quite helpful in problem solving--but again, the university did not add sufficient IT personnel to handle all situations and it was obvious that our IT colleagues were stressed too--too much to handle.

              <li class=""><span>The overall [home institution] response to COVID was amazing. I would like to thank everyone who gave a lot of time and effort to manage this situation. Everyone was responsive and always kept us updated.   It was also very tough for me to suddenly change everything.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I have not received any support. We are all falling apart, exhausted and without resources when we try to do our research.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>One aspect that got worse was the ability that the tech support team has to support phone calls or even reply messages. The tech support in our institution has always been EXCELLENT, but after COVID hit they seem to be understaffed, so on numerous occasions the reply or assistance took a lot longer than it ever did in the past. The are very courteous, as usual, but they simply cannot support the much larger number of people needing assistance since COVID.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The Creative School for Children, while not open full time, due to circumstances out of their control (they need money) offered a learning coach for my school age child last semester.  This was incredibly helpful.  This school is amazing and wonderful in caring for our kids.  They just need help and resources.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I could not compliment or praise the instructional and educational technology departments enough for their rapid response to all the changes that had to be implemented in such a short time. The faculty center for teaching and learning and center for distributed learning responded with faculty trainings and development opportunities to support faculty who had to move to emergency remoted instruction.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>Our department chair did a great job trying to make sure we were able to teach online and sharing information.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I didn&#39;t receive support</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>My chair has been particularly supportive in checking in and doing what they can to help faculty.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I can reply on my colleagues when I need something.  But I have been the one organizing support-- holding meetings, especially for students.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>My dept chair did what she/he could to help faculty get what they needed to teach remotely last spring. And the Tech Help desk has been amazingly helpful</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Administrative staff in department helped to set up a [app] to remind me of due dates/event. That&#39;s very helpful.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>As I mentioned, my department chair has been helpful. I&#39;d rather not give details for fear of being identifiable. But in general our chair has done a good job from protecting us from forced face-to-face classes.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>At the very beginning of the pandemic when we suddenly switched to at-home work, I lost access to important programs and files from my work computer.

              <li class=""><span>My department as whole! One faculty member started a virtual hang out room last March 2020 in Zoom that is open every Friday from 4-6pm. Whoever is free can stop by for fun conversations, work or otherwise-related. On average we have 3-9 faculty members show up every week without fail. We have been meeting every Friday for the last 45 weeks. It has been a life saver.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>I&#39;ve appreciated continuing opportunities for professional development from [home institution] since we no longer have budget for conferences.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[home institution&#39;s] IT worked with SVAD for remote access to office and classroom computers.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I am particularly thankful that [institution] provided an opportunity to apply for exemption to teaching in person when we fall into an at-risk category. I also appreciate my students and colleagues helping each other keep finding ways to stay positive, as well as the graciousness we afford each other.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The support we have received is from within our program, joining together to create policies that will keep our film students safe while having to work on productions, in labs, and using film equipment. This was one particularly effective collaboration among faculty and staff in my department.  The janitorial staff work hard to keep doors clean, and hand sanitizing stations are placed around the building in which I teach, and foot levers for doors and elevators have been installed.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>COlleagues shared online modules when we went online.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>the faculty in my department have a group text that we use regularly to ask questions, vent or reach out for support. Its be very helpful.  I&#39;ve also received tremendous support from the member of our faculty responsible for equipment and facilities. His help navigating new technology needs has been a lifesaver.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Help to resolve administrative problems</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The [academic program] advisors have been particularly helpful in working to keep students on track. We&#39;ve worked together to identify at-risk students and to try to keep them from falling behind. Also Student Counseling Services has provided a LOT of support to students.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>A group of faculty from [STEM] fields have joined together to support one another in writing for positions to leave [institution]. We review one another&#39;s job proposals, have mock interviews, and have Zoom parties when a member gets hired away. I&#39;ve received the best mentorship of my time at [institution] in this group. There is good community at [institution]; the university is just directing it in odd ways.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I had at least four colleagues in my school check in with me in the first few months of the pandemic. I was balancing a child, elderly/disabled [family member with personal and financial concerns], and a first responder [partner] who was working 80+ hour weeks at home while trying to transition three courses to online within one week and run an academic program.   To say I was stressed was an understatement. I was so appreciative of those faculty members who reached out to me and understood why I was missing meetings.   Again, I wish more of our leadership knew what we were going through. Maybe that would have helped them be more supportive and understanding of their faculty. Instead of adding more meetings and responsibilities (including an academic program review), cancel them and catch up later.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>It&#39;s just been nice that I can talk to the chair or other colleagues on occasional. &#34;We&#39;re all in this together&#34;. Nothing in particular, just everything in general.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The staff in our department are always supportive--emotionally as well as &#34;fixing&#34; problems big and small. Our new chair, who started this year and has never met any of us has been a supportive presence on Zoom and online--even arranging get togethers.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning was extremely helpful in helping faculty prepare for online instruction in Fall 2020.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Home institution&#39;s faculty union] bargained a COVID19 MOU with BOT which was considerate of faculty well being.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>My unofficial departmental mentor (a tenured faculty member I trust) has been helpful.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Personal emails from colleagues inquiring about my well being have been the most meaningful.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[home institution&#39;s] provost, Dean and Director board decided to extend the tenure clock application.</span></li>

Second, our Health Services staff have been amazing. Our [testing site] on campus has been superb. Efficient, rapid results. When my [partner/spouse] and I both caught Covid [during winter], our Health Services staff walked us through the harrowing experience every step of the way. I&#39;ve never been more proud to be part of the [home institution] community than in this pandemic. Bravo and go [mascot]!</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[individual] in the library helped me find streaming options for an assignment that doesn&#39;t really work in a virtual environment.  We ended up using[her/his] suggestions in several courses across the department.   Director has been extremely supportive in every way.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The videos that [teaching and learning center] made to help out [specific center] were helpful. The drop in office hours and Technology Tuesdays that [teaching and learning center] offered were helpful with teaching. [individual name] opened a channel through [college of humanities] advising so that those students who were academically struggling in our department&#39;s courses could have yet another point of contact for support and help. Because of this, those students needing help, had both academic advising and [student support office] reach out to students--to try and extend a helping hand.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Center for teaching and learning] came and gave a presentation about best practices for zoom courses. It was incredibly helpful.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>I am teaching a face-to-face mode course at the graduate level. I have also been in quarantine for the majority of the first [number] weeks of classes because of COVID+ student or outside contact. My chair has been extremely supportive of my efforts to keep this course going via synchronous Zoom, at a time when well over half the class is not able to attend  face-to-face because of risks to themselves and/or family. This same level of support has been provided by each one of the staff in our department as well in so many ways.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>IT met me in my classroom to help me get the new technology set up to be able to teach in person and online at the same time (a first for me)</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>I would cite [REDACTED] who does scheduling in the English Department. [He/She] is always great at trying to make the best schedule for me.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>College Dean for Research has provided good guidance for managing research and student training</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>When one student tested positive, we all knew within a few hours what adjustments everyone would have to make, due to the network of emails and texts of faculty from their homes.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>None that I can remember--very difficult time--very isolated time. My support came from home.</span></li>

She regularly holds casual zoom meetings that are open to all as a way of building community, and she has made herself available for small group zoom lunches. She listens.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Colleagues in my college. I [supported] the transition of two of our writing accountability groups to an online platform. We started this at the start of the pandemic and they are going strong. [redacted information] These weekly writing groups have been a huge source of writing productivity, professional and social support during the pandemic. They are so easy to run, when we return to working on campus, I think we will be more flexible and offer a hybrid model for any group member who may need to join from off-campus.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>None</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Clinical assistant dean [REDACTED] has been extremely inclusive and receptive to both student and faculty concerns about covid curriculum planning and execution</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Risk and compliance] Dept.:  They told me about attendance that can be taken via a QR Code rather than distributing attendance forms around class, which can expose students to Covid-19, since the virus lives on material objects.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>N. A.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>My chair noticed I was getting overwhelmed and called me on the phone.  I broke down and cried about many things contributing to my challenges during COVID.  She showed great compassion and understanding and not only made me feel better but suggested some professional and personal tasks to manage it. I got through it but it meant a lot to me that she reached out and really cared.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I cannot think of one thing; per our interim leadership there was very little support (no ordering office supplies for the home, increased zoom meetings, reporting of schedules, etc.).  If anything workloads dramatically increased during the pandemic.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[institution] IT has been extremely supportive as faculty were required to move courses remotely.  They have returned emails, zoom meetings and helped answer all of my questions- in addition, provided several trainings to further support faculty. Excellent support!</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Supportive emails and webcasts to explain policies, updates, university responses.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I think our &#39;COVID times&#39; faculty meetings have been a great way to stay connected even tho there is often no &#39;real&#39; pressing new business to discuss. Also our Zoom group meetings and committee meetings are also a way to stay connected.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>updates during faculty meetings.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Dept chair of business and finance related] checked on me very frequently. He shared techniques for success and guided me in my pedigogy in the new medium, zoom. It was helpful and provided me with the ability to achieve success, as demonstrated by my students&#39; work.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>none</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Our department chair sent packages to each member of department with hand sanitizer, masks, and a personal note. My chair also made sure I had everything I needed to work effectively from home and was supportive when I had childcare conflicts.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I just met with staff at printing services. Even in the pandemic they were willing to meet.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Colleague who has been extremely helpful in helping me to teach online.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>N/A</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The staff in my department made sure that everyone had a camera and microphone to use when we went remote with teaching.  They helped to change our phone system so that we could all be reached.   They also provided numerous &#34;cheat sheets&#34; for the new software, platforms, and services that we needed to use when we all moved to remote working.  The staff really made the departmental transition to remote work successful and smooth.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The other faculty in my department/team have been very supportive of each other in discussions of what works and what doesn’t work and how to best serve the students. The department director has been very helpful with information and resources during the pandemic.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Department chair and Academic advisor accepted and helped exchange my course with another faculty member who was willing to come to campus.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>My chair was very accommodating when it came to allowing me to teach zoom classes instead of face to face.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[Distance Learning Center] - really stepped up to train faculty on distance learning. Huge lift and they did it very well, I would argue the best in [State of home institution] and top ten in the country.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[individual] in the College of Sciences has been particularly helpful in identifying ways to navigate the crisis through [her/his] familiarity with university policies and procedures, particularly when completing searches for faculty and staff.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Department leaders have been good at checking in with us at the beginning of meetings, asking how everyone is doing. I am very fortunate to not have needed much more in terms of support. We had no childcare from March through August -- other faculty asked how I was coping, but it didn&#39;t occur to me that others should have done more. Informal zoom happy hours organized by faculty were nice.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>Our faculty team has communicated more during this time through group text messages to share ideas.  Several faculty members/staff created a remote learning webcourse to share teaching tools and ideas.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The staff has been amazing since day one, from providing PPP to helping with other clerical items.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>My chair forwarded my concerns about my lack of childcare to administration, this made me feel hopeful and that someone cared.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The administrative assistant staff at [home institition] are all spectacular people and have been incredibly helpful.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>A colleague finally told me about a form that we could fill out that would allow us to use university property at home. I was eventually able to retrieve office and computer equipment from my office at work for use at home. When it was evident that we were going to be working from home indefinitely, it is my opinion that this should have been a standard operating procedure for all employees to insure that we had what we needed to work comfortably from home.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>With remote instruction, it proved difficult to understand how to best support students with accessibility issues. In particular I had a student who was medically deaf, and within my state it is not sufficient to implement automatic transcription through video services such as youtube. Student Accessibility Services arranged to have my pre-recorded lectures transcribed to ensure that the student in question could access the material inline with other students in the class. Additionally they arranged for transcriptionists to be present for Office Hour meetings, allowing the student to engage with their TAs and Faculty on demand in a similar way to their colleagues.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>There are four instructions in our academic program and we are all teaching skills classes over Zoom. We created a text group and we daily text each other and share advice, frustrations, support, and just a laugh. It has been a tremendous help for our spirits.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>[Distributed Learning Center] made helpful videos and provided information on its website to instruct faculty regarding manage technology and teaching remotely.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The admin responsible for the online/recording teaching saved my lectures from prior years to aid my fully remote teaching during the pandemic.  This was not [home institution] policy, but a personal kindness.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Our university offered a range of tutorials and support groups to help with transitioning teaching online. This was a wise and timely response to the pandemic.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I felt that my Chair was highly effective and caring throughout the pandemic. I feel that the Chair truly cared about the health and well-being of the faculty in our department.</span></li>

              <li class=""><span>We were unfortunately forced to work in a totally new modality called [hybrid learning model], and it was very challenging. However, the [redacted] Center for Teaching and Learning held multiple workshops every month to help. Additionally, the Center for [redacted] Learning assigns instructional designers to each full time faculty member and they have been very helpful during this time.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Center for Distributed Learning and Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning were outstanding in preparing faculty to transition to online learning.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The most impactful support I received was during the fall semester in 2020, when my department decided to operate all courses fully online. Given the risks associated with in-person attendance, combined with the fact that nearly all sociology courses do not require a physical space, this relieved stress and concern.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Recommending that I see reasonable accommodations under the ADA</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Na</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>None noted...</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>multiple department faculty sent texts to inform  me that the local FEMA site was vaccinating university professors</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>[both faculty teaching and learning offices] offered regular and frequent teaching support workshops or seminars. They are on the ball!</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The instructional designer with whom I worked provided remarkable support in transitioning my courses to an online/remote format. In addition, the junior (pre-tenure track) faculty within my department have been supportive in checking in with one another and sharing resources during this difficult time.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Reverting to online instruction during the pandemic was very helpful!</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I cannot think of any that have offered additional support. I know that our online teaching and technology professionals worked diligently to help faculty move courses online. I already had these skills and content in place. I would have appreciated more efforts to address faculty health concerns, including mental health, family care support, and funding for at-home teaching, such as reimbursement for internet access, etc. For example, there was a request for us to donate sick leave for other faculty who may become ill, and I support this effort, but funding for additional sick leave and family leave should be the responsibility of the university.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>I believe the [center for distance learning] did a great job.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Dean was very helpful in providing materials for face-to-face teaching.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>Zoom, [faculty learning and teaching] online conferences</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>regular emails and portion of Zoom meetings to discuss current feelings and/or issues.</span></li>



              <li class=""><span>The ease at which we could request and receive funding for things like printer toner and tech equipment was impressive. I was pleasantly surprised that the items I needed to perform well were shipped in less than 2 days. Our administrative staff, particularly [individual], are amazing. My direct supervisor,  [individual], was so supportive and helpful (and I am sure [he/she] was overwhelmed with these types of requests at the time).</span></li>
