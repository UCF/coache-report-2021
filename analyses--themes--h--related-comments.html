        <ul>

            <li><span class="comments">Improving equity between titles and compensation between non-TT and TT positions. Far too often, lecturers with terminal degrees are hired who take on [class number] loads and do as much or more research as TT faculty but they are compensated much less. Titles for these positions could be improved to improve equity and standing at the University among faculty (e.g. Asst. Professor of Practice rather than Lecturer as a title).</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Differentiate teaching loads! Teaching loads could be differentiated for various levels of students and based on faculty interest/capability to do research and/or collaborations with graduate students or other faculty</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The climate at [institution] is awful. The word I have used in my 15 years, consistently, about how the [institution] admin treats faculty and staff-- infantilization.  [institution]&#39;s admin, esp. after [number] years of [administrator], is made up, with some important recent hires and exceptions, of people who do not understand academia.  Many are locals, [state] educated, never having really worked in other academic settings, and who see the relationship between the admin and the faculty and staff as adversarial.  It is toxic. Staff are berated, mistreated. I have had staff cry in my office because higher level admin treat them so badly.  Faculty are not trusted, not seen as professionals, not recognized for their hard work. We have no pre-tenure leave—not even one semester to help do the work to earn tenure. I got tenure despite [institution] not because of [institution]. Faculty cannot team teach courses.  Supervising Honors theses and grad student theses/dissertation has no compensation. A course release for every 5 students who completed a thesis would be something.  But no, nothing but a check on a box in the annual evaluation which means nothing. The rationale-- faculty are lazy and trying to take advantage of [institution]. As one [institution] admin told us in a meeting when someone asked why our publications are not receiving any publicity on the website—well that is part of your job, it isn’t newsworthy. I have so many examples.  During my 1st interaction with [administrator], [number] weeks after starting, [s/he] told me I should be grateful [s/he] was honoring my hiring package and did not think I deserved [compensation type]. My [benefit] decision came when I was [experiencing life event] and I couldn’t tell my MA students anything and they knew what was happening.  The [administrator] told me about several meetings to discuss my [benefit].  Was I invited to any of them?  No.  Instead, the [administrator] told me stories about when [his/her] kids were little, and how hard it was.  My youngest was a toddler when [institution] finally put a maternity leave policy in place.  And for all of us that came before—nothing. When the editor at my [publisher] asked for a subvention to publish my book, the [administrator] would not meet with me. [He/she] told my [administrator] that [he/she] would not pay for my publication; it was my book, I had to pay. The publisher was stunned—no university [administrator] had ever said no before. [Institution] lawyers waited so long (nearly 3 months) before renewing a federally funded contract to do collaborative research (that brought in significant funds, provided wonderful opportunities for students, and meant great statewide media coverage), I had to do damage control with the federal agency reps. Why tell us to bring in money if [institution] is going to undermine the process? Why professionally humiliate us when we try?  What is the incentive? It’s all about a fundamental lack of trust.  [institution] does not view us as capable, smart, hard working, professionals.  It sees us as children it has to punish. The most basic example. I cannot update or download even the most basic items on my laptop.  Why?  I might do something inappropriate.  I can’t even install my home printer—I have to have [institution]IT do it for me.  I have always said, [institution] needs to shake up it’s middle and upper level admin.  The top is changing, under it, not so much.  We need more real academics—not people who got a degree at [institution] or somewhere nearby so they could work in university admin.  Everyone in admin needs to teach.  Everyone in [building] should teach lower division and upper division courses in their field.  It is all too clear that no one thinks about the reason we are here.  We are a school.  We are here for the students.  The faculty are the heart of the mission.  [institution] needs to make much clearer that it respects, appreciates and rewards faculty.  Not competitive awards—[teaching incentives, research incentives], etc.  But see how hard we work, how much we put into our teaching, and give us more time to do our research.  And pay attention to the academic calendar.  We changed buildings a few years back.  Admin scheduled the move for [number of weeks] before classes started. Who could think that was a good idea?  I have taught in rooms where the lights won’t turn off, where the equipment is turned so that if you use the computer your back is to the students, and the list goes on.  If everyone had to teach, had to experience what the faculty and students do, from the President on down, I think things would get better.   When a survey of faculty satisfaction occurred several years ago, [institution]’s admin earned super low scores. This, apparently, surprised people in [building[. Instead of really addressing any of the issues, the senior admin sent a handful of faculty fellows to a large meeting (at [a center’s] conference) to ask for input.  Not administrators, faculty. I spoke with one, who explained they had been given marching orders.  Do not return with any reforms that cost money.  No course releases, no pre-tenure leave, no team-taught courses, none of these simple things that would go a long way.  Think about that for a moment—[institution] wants students to have high impact experiences.  I provide many (currently I have [number] [degree] student, [number] MA students, and [number[ PhD students).  I get zero compensation for this work.  Nothing but a box to check on my annual evaluation (and whether I have 1 or 5 it is the same one box).  Think about how much good will and productivity would come from a policy that said for every 5 theses supervised a faculty member got a course release? This was the policy at the [other institution].  Doesn’t cost any extra money but would make a huge difference in terms of morale. Rather than trying to squeeze every drop out of us, how about recognizing how amazing, hardworking, and accomplished the faculty are and implementing solutions that will show us basic, professional courtesy and respect?</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Greater faculty support. Listening to faculty. Coaching and facilitating us. Asking us our career goals and actively reaching out to help us achieve them. Less top down busy work. Less mistrust and contempt of faculty by administrators. Increased respect for faculty&#39;s voice. Acting like we matter to the institution. Recognizing our work. Seeking to build us up, instead of always making us feel we aren&#39;t doing enough. We haven&#39;t gotten any real recognition of all the work we had to do to help students during COVID. No one cares about our mental health, work load, etc. The work just keeps piling on, and yet we are expected to keep producing creative/research works without support or funding. The faculty who hold up the institution with teaching and service are undervalued. Only the faculty who bring in big grant $ seem to get rewarded or recognized.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Deepen opportunities for faculty to research, and produce maximally. Create greater diversity, both in ideas and in campus presence of other populations. Build a greater basis for collegial life; this university is very alienating, and sometimes feels impersonal, because faculty have very scant opportunities to meet, interact, socialize, examine each other&#39;s work, and generally live a collegial life! The University often tends to think of faculty, it seems, as workers and contractors, not as a Deanry of scholars, engaged in high research in a community of knowledge. This in my mind, affects the relationship between work, and the essence of the work done in the university. The university has to offer in sum, an equal acknowledgement of faculty doing work whether in the Humanities or in Science, or in Engineering, or the Social Sciences; and stop creating an academic apartheid of privileges that tend to segregate accomplishments and create dissatisfaction!</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">1) We are incredibly underpaid, it&#39;s insulting.  2) [institution] pays a lot of lip service for things, but is all talk.  There is no real change or programmatic resources allocated to institute change.  Ie, [institution mental health service] is supposed to support students&#39; mental health, but every time I&#39;ve referred a student there they&#39;re told the waiting list is ridiculously long, they can&#39;t get an appointment, etc.  [Institution mental health service] is a public campaign, but no funding to support the substance. Or, [institution] supposedly supports interdisciplinarity, but is so confused about how to recognize or encourage work without siloing it into disciplinary boxes.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Equitable compensation.  We recently had a compression adjustment, which was great, but those of us who earned salary awards had a lower adjustment then those who did not earn awards. Adjustments should NOT take into account competitive awards.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Change the structure for deciding teaching loads. Do not allow this to be decided by mid level supervisors or coordinators. Provide more shared governance with regard to teaching assignments by not only asking what faculty want to teach, but by also respecting those wishes or at least providing solid rationale when they are not respected.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Base salary for lecturers is very low. In addition, lecturers get overlooked in comparison to tenured or tenured track faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">[Institution] needs to adopt policies that reflect its statements about equity, inclusion, diversity by paying fair, equitable salaries and conducting a thorough analysis to identify clear (seemingly unlawful, I would argue) inequities. I am a minority faculty member and a first-generation college student myself, and, sadly, my salary reflects those class-based disadvantages. While I have spent over a year preparing materials and meeting with leadership in my department to correct that, I meanwhile learn that [individual], who was recently placed on leave for [his/her] white supremacist views, received a [percent] raise. I apply for teaching and research awards every year to try to increase my salary, and last year, I saw 2 awards given to someone who already made more than twice as much as me and much more than most people in our department.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Especially with COVID-19 pandemic, leadership at the department, college, and university levels need to be more supportive of faculty and staff. We are going out of our way to transition courses, assist students, care for our kids and elderly parents, and attend a dramatic increase in meetings. Some grace and understanding will go a long way. Morale is very low across multiple units at this time. We are tired and exhausted. Asking us to increase class limits, teach more courses, serve on more committees, etc. is not the answer. Enough!</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Pay the instructors and lecturers as much as the tenure track/tenured faculty who have the same credentials.  It is amazing the salary differences for those who are paid to write and not teach especially when they do not even write.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Leadership with more backbone to stand beside and support their faculty when they need it (rather than a persistent &#39;keep the peace&#39; mentality).</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Changes in leadership - too many interims, no one willing to be transparent and make the right decisions; too many willing to succumb to state pressure and disregard faculty well-being.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Fairness and transparency in leadership are needed.  You don&#39;t preach fairness; you exercise it. You don&#39;t need to send many superficial emails; you communicate important matters.  Realize the truth about the school instead of sugarcoating and fantasizing.  Respect faculty and staff to earn respect.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Pay people. Pay adjuncts a fee that is not insulting. Teaching a 3 credit hour class is worth way more than [amount].  Not to mention we now expect adjuncts to teach online and they have to go through mandatory training that they don&#39;t get paid for!  Pay faculty members, especially new faculty members, a respectable wage. New faculty in my department are offered [amount] with no negotiation allowed--take it or leave it.  How are we supposed to attract the highest quality faculty with that?  I&#39;ve been here more than [number] years and that is only [amount] more than my starting salary.  Seriously, [amount] increase in starting pay in more than [number] years?!?! It is lip service to say we are trying to attract the best faculty. Paying a reasonable salary and recruiting high quality faculty would have a significant positive impact on my workplace.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The way raises are managed is abhorrent. First, the fact that faculty are COMPETING with each other for TIPS and other awards and that THIS is the primary path to getting a raise (outside of promotion) is demeaning. Tons of hours go into those binders/applications for *proving* we are worthy of a raise, and sometimes there are far too many suitable applicants than there are awards to go around. This, combined with the fact that the union needs to negotiate any other cost of living raises, means that the cost of living wage increase is not commensurate with cost of living increases. When my children are finished with school, there will be little reason for me to stay here in way of compensation for my work.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I would like to see [institution] encourage more hiring from within for tenure and administrative positions.  The university seems to put people into a box of whatever position they are hired into - regardless of what additional achievements or credentials they may obtain after their hire.  I was hired as a lecturer and, regardless of how many additional degrees, presentations, or publications I obtain, I will likely need to leave [institution] to obtain a tenure-track position.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Raise salaries to align with [institution] and other [state] universities for lecturer, non-tenure ranks. Provide more travel and professional development funds for lecturer, non-tenure as $500 per year is too low.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Leadership needs to better understand what everyone below does and the immense pressure that faculty and department leaders are under. Leadership just keeps rolling down request after request and there aren&#39;t enough hours in a day to complete those. No life-work balance. Also don&#39;t wait decades to recognize some of your leadership potential in existing faculty. And please stop the bullying that goes on towards faculty and towards department leaders--it&#39;s reached ridiculous levels and little support is offered.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">If you are going to act like a for-profit corporation, develop a system that rewards the productive, dedicated employee. The teaching loads for non-tenure track faculty are not conducive to having time to gather and collate all of the information required to get recognition. The [course evaluations] are subjective and unfair. I have years of high ratings and complimentary reviews and one semester with very detrimental reviews. This has held me back for applying for [teaching incentive] awards and promotion until it falls off the [number] year report period. In the years since those reviews the students have garnered enough negative faculty action to prove there was personal motivation in their reviews.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">consider a more proper balance between administration, teaching and research for faculty. Administrative duties are not valued or compensated properly.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Support social sciences at same levels as other sciences.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The constant push to be #1 or the &#34;best&#34; in all things is like working in an institution that is constantly striving to compete with the better and more recognized older sibling (i.e., [other state universities]). It is a type of self-absorption that is tiring and embarrassing.  First, the university was all about grow, grow, grow.  Now its all about aspiring to some national status.  Either way, faculty expectations are constantly changing and growing more demanding.  The publication norms are ridiculous in my department. It is not possible for a sole person to meet them.  Someone would have to be constantly working with a group of people where the division of labor is so splintered that it is possible to get 3 publications a year. It is not possible for 1 person to do this.  So you are essentially no longer being evaluated based on what you and you alone can do. Everything at this university is a numbers game.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Administration should respect faculty decisions regarding program design &amp; content as well as student policies.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I&#39;d like my institution leaders to value faculty who are not tenured but that are reliable, present, enthusiastic about their work and dedicated to their craft. Maybe one is not getting a top dollar grant or an outstanding award, but what they do on a daily basis for their students should be also recognized as valuable. Since COVID hit, for instance, when most faculty chose not to be back to the classrooms, faculty who did so were barely acknowledged, despite being a mere handful out of dozens. There was almost no recognition of the fact that these faculty members prioritized their many students who were vocal about wanting to be on campus and braved a full semester of face to face classes with responsibility and utmost care, and ended their semester dutifully and without any issues or hazard to themselves of their students.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">As a tenure-earning faculty member, I find it appalling that I am expected to produce grants, research and publications with an FTE of [number] for research. The teaching and service loads are extremely high and no one seems to care or want to help. In my humble opinion, the tenured faculty and administration in my department do not seem to care about my quality of life or stress that I am under.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Recognize and support scholarship and creativity in the liberal arts disciplines as worthy of time, support, and attention. Quit using us as nothing more than [gen ed] teachers mass producing SCHs.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Taking a look at the full picture of what the job is like for the lower paid contingent faculty and those of us on 1-year contracts (who are the folks who also carry the heaviest teaching load). Constantly changing schedules, summer assignments being like a game with unknown rules, paying for our own parking and then having to fight for parking, no official rules/guidance on how departments should handle family obligations so it&#39;s all up to how a department chair feels about children/families, unrelenting pressure to perform and compete for things like awards to increase salary, etc. It&#39;s a pressure cooker, and yet, we also are reminded how thankful we should be that we get to be in this situation since SO MANY people would love to be where we are (which keeps many of us from speaking out).</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Respect and support the faculty</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I would like to see [institution] make more effort to retain female faculty. We have lost a number of excellent female faculty members due to a variety of reasons: sexual harassment, undervaluing/underpaying female faculty, a lack of equity between male and female faculty, and it is harder for female faculty to be promoted at [institution].</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Recognize differentiated roles.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Recognize the role of instructor as the backbone of the teaching duties at the university and taking advantage of the instructor&#39;s strength. Not giving recognition with awards for less effective teaching to people who are on a tenure track so that it &#34;looks good&#34;. Not giving substandards faculty teaching opportunities just because they have PhD and taking them away from a more qualified instructor.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">There are so many things [institution] needs to do to improve our workplace.  1. [institution] needs to determine if we are still striving for preeminent status.  If we are then give faculty the resources and support they need to produce high quality research.  It is not fair to expect high quality research when we are teaching 5 very large courses a year with no GTA and no RA.  2. The [school] has base salaries that are below market rate for our discipline.  Yet, our dean expects us to teach 5 courses during the year with continuing class size increases and publish a minimum of [1 journal article in top tier journals per year.  We have no RA no GTA.  It is incredibly frustrating.  3.  When I was hired I was told by the previous dean that summer teaching of two courses would always be available. This made the pay relatively comparable to other institutions (although I had to work an additional 6 weeks).  Our new dean now says that teaching two classes may not be available. Thus making my salary below market rate for my discipline.  These miscommunications should not occur because of a change of leadership.  4.  The lack of support to convert classes from face  to face to online overnight due to the pandemic was astonishing.  Incredible amounts of time went into the conversion with very limited support from [institution]. This is shameful.  5.  The lack of support for conducting research during the pandemic is also shameful on the part of [institution].  6.  There seems to be an incredible disconnect between [institution]&#39;s overall goals and my dean&#39;s goals.  It is confusing to understand one message from the dean and then to watch the president&#39;s report and hear a different message.  For example, is [institution] trying to grow or not?</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Equity - currently a real lack of equity in pay, workload, expectations, class sizes, tenure requirements, etc. between colleges and even departments.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Provide greater support for mental health, including reasonable accommodations under the ADA</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Above average, competitive compensation in all fields. Faculty in the [division] are paid below national averages across tracks. We are paid barely the same as K-12 teachers in [state], and we are training them. We are paid less than community college faculty in [city]. If we want higher base salaries, we have to go through a rigorous application process to compete for merit based raises which a committee of faculty members have to decide who wins. This is also an issue related to recruitment and retention of diverse faculty. An equally important concern for me is that [institution] has a serious problem with lack of diversity and representation at the highest levels of leadership and among faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The tuition program for our families is pathetic. Other institutions have full tuition programs for their families AND trade programs so faculty/staff can trade tuition with a faculty/staff member at another institution. This seems the &#34;norm&#34; at most other institutions. We can&#39;t even get our family members into the lower division courses at [institution] because we can&#39;t enroll until the Friday before classes begin. This is an absolutely ridiculous program. I will likely leave [institution] because of this...and I have been teaching here for over [number] years. I can&#39;t afford to send our kids to a decent college otherwise. It&#39;s sad that it has come to this. I hate to leave, but it looks like I won&#39;t have a choice. :(</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Compensation must be tied to merit and performance.  I have never earned less than an Outstanding rating on my annual evaluations in [number] years on the faculty at [institution], yet always receive the exact same tiny across the board raise or a few hundred dollars of “bonus” that people who are far less accomplished receive.    After a decade of this I no longer feel compelled to excel.  Why should I not just tread water like the others if I am not going to be recognized or rewarded for my consistently “outstanding” level of performance?  Why do we even HAVE annual evaluations if they are not tied to compensation?  I assure you that my high performing colleagues feel identically, because we talk about it every time “raises” are announced. [Institution] has alienated its top performers by giving them the same participation trophy that those who aren’t as effective (or in some cases outright incompetent) receive.  This is incredibly shortsighted and has begun to cause a measurable decline in faculty output.  There simply is no motivation to excel, so why bother?    While the faculty “union” is largely responsible for this socialist nonsense, the administration is only too willing to agree because it saves them money.  Those of us who are consistently outstanding are easing back on the extra effort because there is no discernible benefit to strive for excellence.    The result from this, as with all socialist policies, is ubiquitous mediocrity.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Improvement is needed in equity of work-load across faculty. There is a strong bias to overload people who have high work-ethic, quality of work to receive more work than those who do not perform as well. There is also a bias toward tenured faculty as untouchable, regardless of ethical behavior.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">[Institution] administration needs to show faculty with actions that they recognize that faculty are the reason [institution] is as good as it is, and that if we&#39;re going to become an R1, then faculty are the ones to do it. So we need [institution]&#39;s support to make that happen. E.g., [institution] could try to: get the amount of bureaucractic nonsense that flows to department chairs and to faculty under control, bargain in good faith with our faculty union, provide adequate grant support for research-active faculty, institute more policies that help our work-life balance, etc.  I feel like the top levels at [institution] (president, provost, VP for research) would agree with all of this, but sometimes I feel like that other levels of administration aren&#39;t yet onboard.  More generally, [institution] needs to keep fighting back against the pressure from the state/BOG to convert us into a technical college full of gig adjuncts teaching 5-5. Yes there are difficult issues in being an enormous university and being subject to the whim of state funding and state regulations, and there&#39;s no doubt that everyone here is working hard, but somehow we have to step back, assess, and do better for our faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reform the award system to make expectations and process more transparent. Currently, instructions lack specificity, leaving much up to the discretion of committees, whose decisions are opaque. Institutional politics and who you know have too much influence. Eligibility rules are too restrictive. Outstanding achievement, not job rank, tenure status, or length of service, should be the most important criteria for all opportunities to earn more.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">This University is too top-down. Many decisions are made at the top without respect for faculty. For example, teaching face to face without a vaccine during covid times, and not allowing for much faculty flexibility.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">respect faculty members by listening to them. They have great knowledge to help [institution] make better decisions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Equality of teaching/research/service assignments.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Administration has a long history of not being transparent and engaging in shared governance, and that was expected to change in the past year with a new admin, but decisions made with respect to remote work and the pandemic have not seemed in line with that expectation.  Lecturers (non tenure-track lines) receive no mentoring, little support, have no ability to negotiate raises (likelihood of receiving outside offers is next to nil when they are not conducting research actively)</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">This institution is too compliance heavy and does not trust faculty.  When in doubt, this institution will leave faculty to hold the bag, to hang and dry, rather than vigorously support faculty.  The risk aversion and compliance culture is out of control.  Plus, non-faculty administrators in various support offices (ethics, compliance, health &amp; safety, General Counsel) seem to run the show.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Faculty salaries, esp. for non-tenure earning faculty, continue to lag behind peer institutions. The university has a drive to constantly innovate and push forward new initiatives—which leads to both an attractive sense of possibility that gets many faculty excited to work here, but also potential feelings of burnout over time. Recognizing via compensation the work teaching-focused faculty do to keep the university moving forward and promote student success would go a long way towards helping NTE faculty be successful here. Promotion for NTE faculty is valuable, but base salaries still lag significantly, especially for faculty who have been here for longer. Tying salary increases almost exclusively to competitive processes like [teaching awards] (that reward individual effort) seems to perhaps work against the sort of collaboration the university seeks to promote, especially interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I think the number one thing that my University could do to improve working conditions would be to change the bonus system currently in place. The primary bonus system is called [name] and it is a system that I feel unfairly awards individuals based upon who you&#39;re friends with on the award committee as opposed to actual hard work. It is very difficult in that many department&#39;s are understaffed and as such have classes and teaching loads that are quite larger then in previous years. These teachers are unable to do creative and unique activities because of the number of students they have. However our bonus structure is based on recognizing these activities. When faculty do not have the ability to engage in the same creative aspects that other department&#39;s do with smaller student populations, it fundamentally makes this system unfair.   The second change I would recommend is better treatment for non tenure track faculty. These individuals are known as either lecturers or instructors at our University and are the backbone of teaching students. However administration and leadership at our institution devalue their worth by not allowing them to serve on committees that only tenure track individuals can serve. There is also higher pay for these individuals than non tenure tract faculty. In the past there was a thought of changing the name of these individuals to teaching professors but tenure track faculty fought this very hard because they did not want to share the title of professor with individuals who &#34;just teach&#34; and do not do research. The primary purpose of the University is to educate students. These individuals are the ones who are teaching large class loads and getting in credit hours to enable professors to do research. They are extremely undervalued and there should be an effort to recognize there accomplishments in contributions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Graduate students are the foundation of a research university. Our administration -- from the [institution] Office of Student Financial Assistance, up to and including the President of [institution], have demonstrated an unsettling lack of understanding as to the role of graduate students -- who they are, what they do, and how they contribute to our university&#39;s mission. [Institution] has lofty ambitions of expanding its international recognition and prominence as an R1 research institution, and yet our base graduate stipends are several thousand dollars below the estimated poverty line for the [regional] area. Particularly worrisome is the treatment (and at times, outright disrespect) towards our graduate students of color -- not necessarily at the individual level, but at the institutional level. For example, the Office of Student Financial Assistance routinely fails to distribute external funding to our graduate students in a timely manner. In one particularly egregious incident, I understand that a PhD student of color was instructed to take out personal loans to make ends meet until his external fellowship -- which was awarded to promote diverse representation in STEM -- came through. In fact the funds had already been transferred to [institution], and there was no legitimate excuse for the delay. Nevertheless, the student was told that nothing could be done, and the student became visibly upset (and justifiably so). In response, rather than attempting to look into the issue to help the student, this graduate student of color was threatened with removal by security. A few hours later, a white male colleague in my department made a phone call to a white male administrator, and the funds were released to the student on the very same day. I share this anecdote because this shameful incident is a consistent pattern with [institution] -- performative dialogue regarding both 1) research excellence and 2) diversity and inclusion, while our very own students too often fall between the cracks. I also share this because I know we can do better. I am happy to acknowledge [institution]&#39;s attempts at progress over the last year, but there is a very long way to go before [institution] is truly an inclusive environment. Expanding resources for graduate students -- most importantly, raising the base stipend to *at least* a living wage -- would be substantially more effective at improving our recruitment/retention abilities for both graduate students and faculty, and would simultaneously make [institution] a more hospitable environment for our students of color. To conclude, it is my view that the single greatest threat to [institution]&#39;s continued success is its lack of investment in graduate students. While it is certainly not too late to address the issue, we are moving too slowly, and risk being left in the dust by our peer institutions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Set compensation based on the number of students a faculty member teaches each academic year.  Ensure there is no difference in pay scale between tenured and non-tenured faculty members.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Provide more raises, and make the process to apply for awards and other applications more automatic and with fewer requirements such as extensive forms that need to be completed.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">We have a wonderful program, unique nationally, and accomplishing much more than others with much larger budgets.  However, a previous administration changed the policy on awards (Pegasus, etc.) and grants that provided a good portion of our operating budget, imperiling our activities.  We are hoping this situation gets rectified and our value to the university is appreciated.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Teaching, research, and service are not &#34;9 to 5&#34; jobs. Recognition of this by the administration and allowing for flexible hours and work from home (without having to formally request it) would hugely benefit my productivity, job satisfaction, and overall quality of life. The workload is incredibly high in my department, but I enjoy my work so I don&#39;t mind, but being given the flexibility to meet these high demands would be wonderful.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Treat the faculty union with respect and communicate with them honestly.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Get non-academic units (Facilities, Parking, etc.) to understand this is a university - don&#39;t schedule construction/parking lot resurfacing during exams, limit AC etc. after 5pm, and so on. Many seem to have forgotten they are here to support the teaching and research.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">There is a complete lack of faculty governance, especially in my college. To grown [institution] so fast the last two decades needed a top-down management culture that persists today, i.e., just &#34;stuff it down their throats.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Adjust mindset to recognize that on-line teaching is generally a &#34;nights and weekends&#34; job, and stop expecting us to ALSO always be available M-F 9-5!</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I have one general suggestion and one specific suggestion. The general one is to cut down on red tape. One of the most striking aspects of coming to [institution] was the amount of red tape and bureaucracy. Nothing seems to be easy – everything seems to take more time and energy than is needed. The influence of risk management seems to be quite high in the university – avoiding legal issues seems to be the primary explanation for all of the extra rules and paperwork. Although I understand the need to minimize risk and to ensure ethical behavior, that emphasis can also become highly burdensome to the point that it decreases the productivity of the faculty. There has to be a reasonable balance. I would love for our leadership to actively seek out where there is unnecessary red tape and do what it can to minimize it – doing so may be one of the most impactful steps that could be taken to increase the productivity of the university faculty. This is especially true in the Office of Research. A great example is when an opportunity comes to bring in a small external contract. I have heard over and over again, and have experienced personally, all the barriers that are put into place when an outside company or institution wants to pay our faculty and/or students to do an applied project for them. Whether it’s due to [institution]’s unreasonable stance on the overhead/indirect rates or the amount of paperwork involved or the length of time it takes to get approved, I have seen or heard of many opportunities that are lost because [institution] simply makes it too hard to bring in this money. This seems inconsistent with the university calling itself the partnership university. This is just one example. The university leadership should actively solicit feedback from faculty on an ongoing basis on what systems or processes are unnecessarily burdensome or difficult, and then take necessary and reasonable steps to fix these issues.   My second suggestion is much more specific. I would love it if the university could figure out a way to efficiently get small pots of money (i.e., less than $5K) to faculty to support their research. I bring in a good amount of external grant money, but those funds are earmarked for very specific purposes. There are internal mechanisms to get research support, but they tend to be larger and/or create a lot of work for everyone (long applications, committees to review the applications, etc.). It would be great if the university could figure out a more efficient way to support faculty research in small ways, especially faculty who have shown that they are highly productive and bring in grant funds to the university. One possibility would be to have a simple automatic way for faculty to get a small seed grant (maybe $3000-5000) every few years. There could be some basic criteria and mechanisms to spread the funds around, hopefully without creating more bureaucracy (e.g., committees that have to review applications, etc.). However, an even easier course of action would be to increase the amount of money from indirects that goes back to the faculty, because right now it is fairly paltry. Maybe it could be some sort of match from the university up to a certain amount. By doing this, faculty who have already proven that they can bring in research funds get rewarded, and the funds go to those who are the most likely to put the funds to use to bring in more funds that would benefit the university. The same could be said for buying out – the university benefits greatly when faculty use grant funds to buy out of teaching, and yet there is actually little additional incentive to do so beyond the reduced teaching load. Again, by incentivizing this type of behavior (e.g., by adding a percentage of the buyout funds to the faculty’s research account), the university would be rewarding behavior that benefits it and puts more funds into the hands of faculty who are most likely to use it in beneficial ways in the future.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">We have a 70 to 1 student to faculty ratio in our department.  This CANNOT be fixed in any significant way at this point by hiring more faculty, nor will we decrease the number of students (it is actually increasing). They only way to deal with the situation that senior administration has allowed to happen is to get the resources we need to teach that many students.  Our department has more students (4200 undergrads) than some UNIVERSITIES. But we have 6 staff members. Six.  In a class of 250 students we get 2 TAs because the allotment of TA waivers from the [graduate college] to the departments is anemic.  At my previous institution I had 20+ undergrad TAs AND 2 PhD TAs for a class of that size.  We simply teach too many sections of too many students for that pitiful support to make a dent. Students are not getting the personal attention they need to succeed and then it is the faculty&#39;s fault that they are not graduating in high enough percentages after 4 or 5 years.  I wonder why.  We have a ridiculous Administrator and Staff to Faculty ratio (universities should be required to report this).  I could hire all the teach support the department needs for a year at the cost of 1 of our meaningless associate vice president provost senior mumblefrat no one knows what positions in the university or maybe a couple of people from the general counsel&#39;s office.  Enrollment was mismanaged and has spiraled out of control, completely beyond the capability of any one person to dial it back.  Resources have not tracked commensurately (understatement of the year). &#34;Be more creative&#34;.  Come up with novel solutions as faculty to make the current untenable situations we&#39;ve placed you in survivable.  So we have adapted.  We have persisted.  But we are not winning.  It is a losing battle and we are losing our best people to  other places where there is still hope.  Unless a massive---truly MASSIVE shift of resources (and I mean dollars, cold hard cash) is made toward investment in faculty hiring and TA/[undergraduate learning assistant] resources the problem will never be solved.  The best faculty who want to remain loyal will slave away, overworked and underpaid, trying their best to &#34;be creative&#34; and come up with innovative solutions to these administration-created problems, with no acknowledgment of error or even a &#34;we get it and we&#39;re trying to help you&#34; from the administration, but eventually even the strongest will crack and finally crumble.  Leave or retire.  Succumb to the inevitable while the administration&#39;s response will simply be &#34;Charge on.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The one thing I think that would help is to continue to recognize the value of non-tenure earning (NTE) faculty. [Institution] is better than some other institutions when it comes to this, but there is still what I feel an &#34;outdated&#34; view of NTE faculty. For example, we are the only group to be classified by &#34;what we are not.&#34; I believe there is great value in teaching, and there is also research done on teaching and learning. Recognizing this value as equal to someone pulling in grants and other research I think would be a great step in the right direction.</span></li>
