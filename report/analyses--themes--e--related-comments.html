            <li><span class="comments">Improving equity between titles and compensation between non-TT and TT positions. Far too often, lecturers with terminal degrees are hired who take on [class number] loads and do as much or more research as TT faculty but they are compensated much less. Titles for these positions could be improved to improve equity and standing at the University among faculty (e.g. Asst. Professor of Practice rather than Lecturer as a title).</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">To achieve the goal of becoming a true leader in interdisciplinary teaching and research, the workplace requires more balance in the design and revision of joint appointments for humanities faculty for to the success of professional programs and ultimately, to achieve the goal of providing integrative liberal education and research.   These joint appointments to the best of my knowledge fail to calculate the additional burden of: preparing two annual reviews, having two chairs, 2 deans, working at two different distant campuses; working with different academic schedules (9 month x 11 month); adapting to two different academic cultures. Nothing here is the norm for the single department faculty.  The onboarding of joint faculty should be rigorously balanced not to overwhelm and the faculty should be protected and provided special joint mentoring at the university level.   Those joint faculty that accept directorships should be offered at least one course release to rebalance the time used for this role, which requires multiple meetings and faculty development. Preferably, some compensation for the role should be added as well. The phenomenon of someone being a 40% director due to college appointment distribution is an artifact - it is a continuous job and position.    Effective mentoring might be done by panels of joint appointed faculty mentors and follow-ups. Many mentors, while offering support, are not jointly appointed themselves, which limits their perspective. Mentoring should also include administration, for supporting directorship development for assistant professors.  The tenure evaluation of joint appointed faculty needs revision with more attention for preparation and streamlining.   Not least, joint appointments should equitably reflect the pay scale of the work distribution between colleges. The joint appointed faculty is counted for accreditation purposes and provides the linchpin contribution for curriculum development in the professional program. Other universities, for comparison sake, use proportional pay scales for joint appointments, meaning that equal work and comparable job preparation (Phds, etc) are compensated equitably in the professional program with other single appointed faculty.</span></li>

And yet, when I call webcourse support it takes 3 days or more before they get back to me (with several times it taking more than a week)! By that time, the unresolved problem has become a huge problem to my students and many are angry with me though I have no control over the situation. This problem has been going on for more than one year. Why didn&#39;t the University just hire more tech people given the greater numbers who would be relying on them the last three months?</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Salaries are inequitable based on gender and race. This has been a known problem for years, and [home university] does not seem serious about addressing it. It is demoralizing.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">I would like to see [institution] place more focus on equity and inclusion practices from the student body up to faculty positions. A serious framework should be developed that elevates underrepresented groups and shows that we are a coherent plan to address inequities across all aspects of our institution.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I don&#39;t know about the &#34;number one&#34; thing. But one thing that comes immediately to mind is that we need the institution needs to develop more clarity around faculty governance. In a case in which I was on a search committee, it was clear that a department faculty preferred an external candidate but the Dean did not.  So, the Dean (as the hiring official) made the offer to the internal candidate. This occurs because the hiring official has decision-making power rather than a voting body. But it&#39;s evidence of the kind of nominal involvement faculty feel like they have in this process and others -- the faculty were involved in the everyday labor of the search: reviewing applications, interviewing candidates, conducting the campus visit, but ultimately the decision was in the hands of the Dean who seemed to have made up their mind in advance. Internal hires seem more prevalent here than anywhere else I&#39;ve worked, and I&#39;m not always sure that external candidates are actually considered for open positions. We have had several searches (faculty and administrative) in which internal candidates are hired and our college continues to hire graduates from it&#39;s own PhD program rather than diversifying its faculty with expertise and experience from beyond our institution.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">The climate at [institution] is awful. The word I have used in my 15 years, consistently, about how the [institution] admin treats faculty and staff-- infantilization.  [institution]&#39;s admin, esp. after [number] years of [administrator], is made up, with some important recent hires and exceptions, of people who do not understand academia.  Many are locals, [state] educated, never having really worked in other academic settings, and who see the relationship between the admin and the faculty and staff as adversarial.  It is toxic. Staff are berated, mistreated. I have had staff cry in my office because higher level admin treat them so badly.  Faculty are not trusted, not seen as professionals, not recognized for their hard work. We have no pre-tenure leave—not even one semester to help do the work to earn tenure. I got tenure despite [institution] not because of [institution]. Faculty cannot team teach courses.  Supervising Honors theses and grad student theses/dissertation has no compensation. A course release for every 5 students who completed a thesis would be something.  But no, nothing but a check on a box in the annual evaluation which means nothing. The rationale-- faculty are lazy and trying to take advantage of [institution]. As one [institution] admin told us in a meeting when someone asked why our publications are not receiving any publicity on the website—well that is part of your job, it isn’t newsworthy. I have so many examples.  During my 1st interaction with [administrator], [number] weeks after starting, [s/he] told me I should be grateful [s/he] was honoring my hiring package and did not think I deserved [compensation type]. My [benefit] decision came when I was [experiencing life event] and I couldn’t tell my MA students anything and they knew what was happening.  The [administrator] told me about several meetings to discuss my [benefit].  Was I invited to any of them?  No.  Instead, the [administrator] told me stories about when [his/her] kids were little, and how hard it was.  My youngest was a toddler when [institution] finally put a maternity leave policy in place.  And for all of us that came before—nothing. When the editor at my [publisher] asked for a subvention to publish my book, the [administrator] would not meet with me. [He/she] told my [administrator] that [he/she] would not pay for my publication; it was my book, I had to pay. The publisher was stunned—no university [administrator] had ever said no before. [Institution] lawyers waited so long (nearly 3 months) before renewing a federally funded contract to do collaborative research (that brought in significant funds, provided wonderful opportunities for students, and meant great statewide media coverage), I had to do damage control with the federal agency reps. Why tell us to bring in money if [institution] is going to undermine the process? Why professionally humiliate us when we try?  What is the incentive? It’s all about a fundamental lack of trust.  [institution] does not view us as capable, smart, hard working, professionals.  It sees us as children it has to punish. The most basic example. I cannot update or download even the most basic items on my laptop.  Why?  I might do something inappropriate.  I can’t even install my home printer—I have to have [institution]IT do it for me.  I have always said, [institution] needs to shake up it’s middle and upper level admin.  The top is changing, under it, not so much.  We need more real academics—not people who got a degree at [institution] or somewhere nearby so they could work in university admin.  Everyone in admin needs to teach.  Everyone in [building] should teach lower division and upper division courses in their field.  It is all too clear that no one thinks about the reason we are here.  We are a school.  We are here for the students.  The faculty are the heart of the mission.  [institution] needs to make much clearer that it respects, appreciates and rewards faculty.  Not competitive awards—[teaching incentives, research incentives], etc.  But see how hard we work, how much we put into our teaching, and give us more time to do our research.  And pay attention to the academic calendar.  We changed buildings a few years back.  Admin scheduled the move for [number of weeks] before classes started. Who could think that was a good idea?  I have taught in rooms where the lights won’t turn off, where the equipment is turned so that if you use the computer your back is to the students, and the list goes on.  If everyone had to teach, had to experience what the faculty and students do, from the President on down, I think things would get better.   When a survey of faculty satisfaction occurred several years ago, [institution]’s admin earned super low scores. This, apparently, surprised people in [building[. Instead of really addressing any of the issues, the senior admin sent a handful of faculty fellows to a large meeting (at [a center’s] conference) to ask for input.  Not administrators, faculty. I spoke with one, who explained they had been given marching orders.  Do not return with any reforms that cost money.  No course releases, no pre-tenure leave, no team-taught courses, none of these simple things that would go a long way.  Think about that for a moment—[institution] wants students to have high impact experiences.  I provide many (currently I have [number] [degree] student, [number] MA students, and [number[ PhD students).  I get zero compensation for this work.  Nothing but a box to check on my annual evaluation (and whether I have 1 or 5 it is the same one box).  Think about how much good will and productivity would come from a policy that said for every 5 theses supervised a faculty member got a course release? This was the policy at the [other institution].  Doesn’t cost any extra money but would make a huge difference in terms of morale. Rather than trying to squeeze every drop out of us, how about recognizing how amazing, hardworking, and accomplished the faculty are and implementing solutions that will show us basic, professional courtesy and respect?</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Greater faculty support. Listening to faculty. Coaching and facilitating us. Asking us our career goals and actively reaching out to help us achieve them. Less top down busy work. Less mistrust and contempt of faculty by administrators. Increased respect for faculty&#39;s voice. Acting like we matter to the institution. Recognizing our work. Seeking to build us up, instead of always making us feel we aren&#39;t doing enough. We haven&#39;t gotten any real recognition of all the work we had to do to help students during COVID. No one cares about our mental health, work load, etc. The work just keeps piling on, and yet we are expected to keep producing creative/research works without support or funding. The faculty who hold up the institution with teaching and service are undervalued. Only the faculty who bring in big grant $ seem to get rewarded or recognized.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">My department&#39;s culture is one of gossip behind closed doors, a small cabal influencing the chair and everyone else being ignored, and general hostility among faculty that no one will even admit. It&#39;s hard to articulate how the institution as a whole could change this, but the &#34;it&#39;s only the individuals&#34; explanations don&#39;t help either. The fact is, the institution sets out constant competition as the ideal, and this makes it hard for sub-units to do anything else. The university always puts programs into place that superficially seem to provide resources and change, but that aren&#39;t substantive and do not really effect any change. They just require us to receive more email spam and bureaucratic requirements when what we actually need is to cut administrative offices and use that funding to provide lighter teaching loads, regular sabbaticals, and other kinds of day-to-day support for faculty.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">There are no consequences for dishonesty from senior leadership, from selling PhDs to the provost flatly lying about what faculty want in order to justify his own decisions.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">1) We are incredibly underpaid, it&#39;s insulting.  2) [institution] pays a lot of lip service for things, but is all talk.  There is no real change or programmatic resources allocated to institute change.  Ie, [institution mental health service] is supposed to support students&#39; mental health, but every time I&#39;ve referred a student there they&#39;re told the waiting list is ridiculously long, they can&#39;t get an appointment, etc.  [Institution mental health service] is a public campaign, but no funding to support the substance. Or, [institution] supposedly supports interdisciplinarity, but is so confused about how to recognize or encourage work without siloing it into disciplinary boxes.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Pre-pandemic: refining job descriptions, work allocations, policy/procedures to guide decision making Pandemic world: I feel [home university] is doing the best it can!!</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Change the structure for deciding teaching loads. Do not allow this to be decided by mid level supervisors or coordinators. Provide more shared governance with regard to teaching assignments by not only asking what faculty want to teach, but by also respecting those wishes or at least providing solid rationale when they are not respected.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">[Institution] needs to adopt policies that reflect its statements about equity, inclusion, diversity by paying fair, equitable salaries and conducting a thorough analysis to identify clear (seemingly unlawful, I would argue) inequities. I am a minority faculty member and a first-generation college student myself, and, sadly, my salary reflects those class-based disadvantages. While I have spent over a year preparing materials and meeting with leadership in my department to correct that, I meanwhile learn that [individual], who was recently placed on leave for [his/her] white supremacist views, received a [percent] raise. I apply for teaching and research awards every year to try to increase my salary, and last year, I saw 2 awards given to someone who already made more than twice as much as me and much more than most people in our department.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">The overall communication and structure with so many changes of leadership and combining our College to be so large and combined with so many parts and moving pieces and locations I call it the land of misfit toys.  Working in the College is not pleasant with colleagues who have joined from somewhat toxic departments or who do not understand each other making it hard to enjoy the overall culture of a University with so many changes and not settling in really any area from department, college, and university.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Please return [institution] to the mission it thrived under in the &#39;90s and early 21st century.  The strong and objective drive we enjoyed during that time under the priority areas of science and technology was clearly more rigorous and more effective.  We were aspiring to be the next MIT in those days--it seemed to be so much about talent, intelligence, hard work, and competition.  The new objective to be &#34;elite without elitism&#34; strikes me as off the mark, weak, subjectively biased, and self-deprecating.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">There are some faculty members shouldering tremendous service loads that are not compensated for in any way, especially when those faculty members are non tenure earning. The discrepancy between faculty there can be tremendous. Faculty who carry substantially larger service workloads should be compensated with course release.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">[Institution] tends to push the ideology that bigger is better and they emphasize throughput over quality. This, coupled with an aggressive pursuit to get to the top without the resources necessary to support faculty has created a cut-throat, stressful, and toxic environment that disproportionally and negatively impacts women and minorities.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">I wish that leaders would be more open about why they make decisions, particularly during the pandemic.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Overhaul its senior leadership. Commit to transparency and shared governance (and not just lip service to these). Provide more oversight of those in leadership roles so that toxic work environments and rock-bottom morale can be addressed proactively.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Especially with COVID-19 pandemic, leadership at the department, college, and university levels need to be more supportive of faculty and staff. We are going out of our way to transition courses, assist students, care for our kids and elderly parents, and attend a dramatic increase in meetings. Some grace and understanding will go a long way. Morale is very low across multiple units at this time. We are tired and exhausted. Asking us to increase class limits, teach more courses, serve on more committees, etc. is not the answer. Enough!</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Leadership with more backbone to stand beside and support their faculty when they need it (rather than a persistent &#39;keep the peace&#39; mentality).</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Changes in leadership - too many interims, no one willing to be transparent and make the right decisions; too many willing to succumb to state pressure and disregard faculty well-being.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Fairness and transparency in leadership are needed.  You don&#39;t preach fairness; you exercise it. You don&#39;t need to send many superficial emails; you communicate important matters.  Realize the truth about the school instead of sugarcoating and fantasizing.  Respect faculty and staff to earn respect.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Equitable salaries, especially for faculty who have been at [institution] for a longer time - the issues of salary compression and salary inversion are real and they lead to animosity and competition in the work environment. The second issue is the top-down model of decision making, especially among people like [redacted] who create discriminatory policies with no research or justification. Rather than address faculty who might be problematic, we have a sweeping policy created that discriminates against married people in an institution that tries to portray itself as family-friendly by having marital hiring opportunities.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Leadership needs to better understand what everyone below does and the immense pressure that faculty and department leaders are under. Leadership just keeps rolling down request after request and there aren&#39;t enough hours in a day to complete those. No life-work balance. Also don&#39;t wait decades to recognize some of your leadership potential in existing faculty. And please stop the bullying that goes on towards faculty and towards department leaders--it&#39;s reached ridiculous levels and little support is offered.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">we have corrupt leadership who has conflict of interest on the departmental level with self-promotion, self dealing, hiring without doing a true search or looking for diversity, nepotism and lack of transparency. There is a cabal of full professors who pursue career growth and titles and leave all the rest of the people to do the teaching and drudgery work and have monopolized all resources that would allow hiring of adjuncts etc.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">Consistent salary increases to match changes in cost of living and the elimination of competitive awards that put faculty against one another</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">It should be noted that my responses to your survey are based on two major considerations.  First, our department has had an [administrator] for over [number] years (a tenured faculty member/full professor who has worked in the department for [number]+ years). Under this person&#39;s leadership, esteemed researchers/faculty members have resigned/retired/left to go to other institutions because of this [administrator’s] authoritative leadership style - which has profoundly impacted the department (negatively) -- particularly faculty in leadership positions (program director positions, etc.).  There is no open communication &#34;permitted&#34; - this is one of many examples.  At any rate, this has resulted in a non-trusting large group of faculty with low morale, etc.  Further, a new Dean for the college was hired at the same time the [administrator] took over.  Faculty rarely hear from the Dean (twice that I can recall), and the [administrator] has made it clear that faculty are not &#34;permitted&#34; to reach out to the Dean (the [administrator] must be the one to do this).   Having said all of this, the University/Department (after two failed searches) successfully completed a search (recently) for the [administrator] position - and the new [administrator] is anticipated to start in early [month].  In consultation with other colleagues, it has been agreed that our department will need some time to &#34;heal&#34; from the past two years...we are hopeful that the new [administrator] will understand the situation.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">The Interim Director of our department has destroyed it.  There is now  a culture of disrespect and apathy and punishment.  The Dean of [division] is largely absent in terms of any presence with us - we never see [her/him], speak with [her/him], interact with [her/him].  Very different than previous Deans; [her/him] opinions of the [division] have to be based on what is told to him by the Interim Director/not a good thing.   Interaction I&#39;ve had with him (limited) has been uncomfortable and off-putting.  Thankfully, we have a new Director finally hired to end this [number] year reign of abuse.  [Institution] could have helped us more; we asked for help and got none.  The culture now is that it doesn&#39;t matter if you try to do a good job or not; it just doesn&#39;t matter.  Hard for those of us who take pride in our work to live under these circumstances.  [Institution] should help faculty who reach out for help with their workplace problems; not act like they are trying to help but there is no positive outcome or communication.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">At college meetings, teaching should be discussed more.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">I don&#39;t feel supported when I report bad behavior by faculty.  As a [administrative role], I hear numerous stories about faculty behaving badly.  These reports come from undergraduate students, graduate students, and colleagues.  I send these reports upward, but nothing ever happens.  I have [number] faculty in my department who regularly abuse students (not physically), I have reported each of them at least 4=5 times, and nothing has ever happened to them.  As [administrative role], that makes me look like I&#39;m not doing anything about these reports.  I feel like the only faculty who experience repercussions for their behavior are faculty who are REALLY offensive (and probably make the news). This makes it extremely hard to be a [administrative role].</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">The constant push to be #1 or the &#34;best&#34; in all things is like working in an institution that is constantly striving to compete with the better and more recognized older sibling (i.e., [other state universities]). It is a type of self-absorption that is tiring and embarrassing.  First, the university was all about grow, grow, grow.  Now its all about aspiring to some national status.  Either way, faculty expectations are constantly changing and growing more demanding.  The publication norms are ridiculous in my department. It is not possible for a sole person to meet them.  Someone would have to be constantly working with a group of people where the division of labor is so splintered that it is possible to get 3 publications a year. It is not possible for 1 person to do this.  So you are essentially no longer being evaluated based on what you and you alone can do. Everything at this university is a numbers game.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">My biggest complaint is how COVID was handled. Faculty were shocked that decisions were made based entirely on political force and lacked any emphasis on pedagogy or faculty safety.

            <li><span class="comments">There are so many things [institution] needs to do to improve our workplace.  1. [institution] needs to determine if we are still striving for preeminent status.  If we are then give faculty the resources and support they need to produce high quality research.  It is not fair to expect high quality research when we are teaching 5 very large courses a year with no GTA and no RA.  2. The [school] has base salaries that are below market rate for our discipline.  Yet, our dean expects us to teach 5 courses during the year with continuing class size increases and publish a minimum of [1 journal article in top tier journals per year.  We have no RA no GTA.  It is incredibly frustrating.  3.  When I was hired I was told by the previous dean that summer teaching of two courses would always be available. This made the pay relatively comparable to other institutions (although I had to work an additional 6 weeks).  Our new dean now says that teaching two classes may not be available. Thus making my salary below market rate for my discipline.  These miscommunications should not occur because of a change of leadership.  4.  The lack of support to convert classes from face  to face to online overnight due to the pandemic was astonishing.  Incredible amounts of time went into the conversion with very limited support from [institution]. This is shameful.  5.  The lack of support for conducting research during the pandemic is also shameful on the part of [institution].  6.  There seems to be an incredible disconnect between [institution]&#39;s overall goals and my dean&#39;s goals.  It is confusing to understand one message from the dean and then to watch the president&#39;s report and hear a different message.  For example, is [institution] trying to grow or not?</span></li>

We are paid barely the same as K-12 teachers in [state], and we are training them. We are paid less than community college faculty in [city]. If we want higher base salaries, we have to go through a rigorous application process to compete for merit based raises which a committee of faculty members have to decide who wins. This is also an issue related to recruitment and retention of diverse faculty. An equally important concern for me is that [institution] has a serious problem with lack of diversity and representation at the highest levels of leadership and among faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Compensation must be tied to merit and performance.  I have never earned less than an Outstanding rating on my annual evaluations in [number] years on the faculty at [institution], yet always receive the exact same tiny across the board raise or a few hundred dollars of “bonus” that people who are far less accomplished receive.    After a decade of this I no longer feel compelled to excel.  Why should I not just tread water like the others if I am not going to be recognized or rewarded for my consistently “outstanding” level of performance?  Why do we even HAVE annual evaluations if they are not tied to compensation?  I assure you that my high performing colleagues feel identically, because we talk about it every time “raises” are announced. [Institution] has alienated its top performers by giving them the same participation trophy that those who aren’t as effective (or in some cases outright incompetent) receive.  This is incredibly shortsighted and has begun to cause a measurable decline in faculty output.  There simply is no motivation to excel, so why bother?    While the faculty “union” is largely responsible for this socialist nonsense, the administration is only too willing to agree because it saves them money.  Those of us who are consistently outstanding are easing back on the extra effort because there is no discernible benefit to strive for excellence.    The result from this, as with all socialist policies, is ubiquitous mediocrity.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">[Institution] administration needs to show faculty with actions that they recognize that faculty are the reason [institution] is as good as it is, and that if we&#39;re going to become an R1, then faculty are the ones to do it. So we need [institution]&#39;s support to make that happen. E.g., [institution] could try to: get the amount of bureaucractic nonsense that flows to department chairs and to faculty under control, bargain in good faith with our faculty union, provide adequate grant support for research-active faculty, institute more policies that help our work-life balance, etc.  I feel like the top levels at [institution] (president, provost, VP for research) would agree with all of this, but sometimes I feel like that other levels of administration aren&#39;t yet onboard.  More generally, [institution] needs to keep fighting back against the pressure from the state/BOG to convert us into a technical college full of gig adjuncts teaching 5-5. Yes there are difficult issues in being an enormous university and being subject to the whim of state funding and state regulations, and there&#39;s no doubt that everyone here is working hard, but somehow we have to step back, assess, and do better for our faculty.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">With [number] students and just under [number] faculty, we cannot pretend to offer practical experience to most of our students, as all research universities must.  We play at it, and some departments achieve it through the accident of having few majors, but we are not, on the whole, a research university.  Many departments&#39; majors outnumber the faculty 100:1.  It is impossible for those faculty to offer any meaningful research or scholarly experience to most of the majors, nor is it possible for them to place their students in research experiences elsewhere.  Until we can bring our enrollment and faculty size in line with each other, we will not be a top-[number] research university, and some would argue we will not really be a research university at all.  This effort needs to be an all-fronts battle.  We cannot reduce students without reducing faculty, given how the state allocates funds, unless we raise money in other ways.  We need to reduce students AND sell our product to the state to change their allocation formulas AND raise funds from other sources.  Recent changes in leadership give this a hope of happening, but it will take time, perhaps more time than many will have patience for.  It will be utterly critical to retain [President] and the outstanding leadership team he is building.  It is equally critical to incorporate these goals into his goals from the Board, and to hold him and his team accountable to them.

            <li><span class="comments">Graduate students are the foundation of a research university. Our administration -- from the [institution] Office of Student Financial Assistance, up to and including the President of [institution], have demonstrated an unsettling lack of understanding as to the role of graduate students -- who they are, what they do, and how they contribute to our university&#39;s mission. [Institution] has lofty ambitions of expanding its international recognition and prominence as an R1 research institution, and yet our base graduate stipends are several thousand dollars below the estimated poverty line for the [regional] area. Particularly worrisome is the treatment (and at times, outright disrespect) towards our graduate students of color -- not necessarily at the individual level, but at the institutional level. For example, the Office of Student Financial Assistance routinely fails to distribute external funding to our graduate students in a timely manner. In one particularly egregious incident, I understand that a PhD student of color was instructed to take out personal loans to make ends meet until his external fellowship -- which was awarded to promote diverse representation in STEM -- came through. In fact the funds had already been transferred to [institution], and there was no legitimate excuse for the delay. Nevertheless, the student was told that nothing could be done, and the student became visibly upset (and justifiably so). In response, rather than attempting to look into the issue to help the student, this graduate student of color was threatened with removal by security. A few hours later, a white male colleague in my department made a phone call to a white male administrator, and the funds were released to the student on the very same day. I share this anecdote because this shameful incident is a consistent pattern with [institution] -- performative dialogue regarding both 1) research excellence and 2) diversity and inclusion, while our very own students too often fall between the cracks. I also share this because I know we can do better. I am happy to acknowledge [institution]&#39;s attempts at progress over the last year, but there is a very long way to go before [institution] is truly an inclusive environment. Expanding resources for graduate students -- most importantly, raising the base stipend to *at least* a living wage -- would be substantially more effective at improving our recruitment/retention abilities for both graduate students and faculty, and would simultaneously make [institution] a more hospitable environment for our students of color. To conclude, it is my view that the single greatest threat to [institution]&#39;s continued success is its lack of investment in graduate students. While it is certainly not too late to address the issue, we are moving too slowly, and risk being left in the dust by our peer institutions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I have one general suggestion and one specific suggestion. The general one is to cut down on red tape. One of the most striking aspects of coming to [institution] was the amount of red tape and bureaucracy. Nothing seems to be easy – everything seems to take more time and energy than is needed. The influence of risk management seems to be quite high in the university – avoiding legal issues seems to be the primary explanation for all of the extra rules and paperwork. Although I understand the need to minimize risk and to ensure ethical behavior, that emphasis can also become highly burdensome to the point that it decreases the productivity of the faculty. There has to be a reasonable balance. I would love for our leadership to actively seek out where there is unnecessary red tape and do what it can to minimize it – doing so may be one of the most impactful steps that could be taken to increase the productivity of the university faculty. This is especially true in the Office of Research. A great example is when an opportunity comes to bring in a small external contract. I have heard over and over again, and have experienced personally, all the barriers that are put into place when an outside company or institution wants to pay our faculty and/or students to do an applied project for them. Whether it’s due to [institution]’s unreasonable stance on the overhead/indirect rates or the amount of paperwork involved or the length of time it takes to get approved, I have seen or heard of many opportunities that are lost because [institution] simply makes it too hard to bring in this money. This seems inconsistent with the university calling itself the partnership university. This is just one example. The university leadership should actively solicit feedback from faculty on an ongoing basis on what systems or processes are unnecessarily burdensome or difficult, and then take necessary and reasonable steps to fix these issues.   My second suggestion is much more specific. I would love it if the university could figure out a way to efficiently get small pots of money (i.e., less than $5K) to faculty to support their research. I bring in a good amount of external grant money, but those funds are earmarked for very specific purposes. There are internal mechanisms to get research support, but they tend to be larger and/or create a lot of work for everyone (long applications, committees to review the applications, etc.). It would be great if the university could figure out a more efficient way to support faculty research in small ways, especially faculty who have shown that they are highly productive and bring in grant funds to the university. One possibility would be to have a simple automatic way for faculty to get a small seed grant (maybe $3000-5000) every few years. There could be some basic criteria and mechanisms to spread the funds around, hopefully without creating more bureaucracy (e.g., committees that have to review applications, etc.). However, an even easier course of action would be to increase the amount of money from indirects that goes back to the faculty, because right now it is fairly paltry. Maybe it could be some sort of match from the university up to a certain amount. By doing this, faculty who have already proven that they can bring in research funds get rewarded, and the funds go to those who are the most likely to put the funds to use to bring in more funds that would benefit the university. The same could be said for buying out – the university benefits greatly when faculty use grant funds to buy out of teaching, and yet there is actually little additional incentive to do so beyond the reduced teaching load. Again, by incentivizing this type of behavior (e.g., by adding a percentage of the buyout funds to the faculty’s research account), the university would be rewarding behavior that benefits it and puts more funds into the hands of faculty who are most likely to use it in beneficial ways in the future.</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">[Institution] could commit in MORE THAN JUST WORDS to make the university a truly inclusive and representative space. A major piece of this would be centralizing diversity efforts on campus with significant resources to enact change across the university, in part by consolidating efforts. [Institution] could hire a VP for Diversity and Inclusion that reports directly to the president. [Institution] also needs to make it an active priority to make faculty (in particular) more than representative racially and ethnically, and to provide ongoing support for faculty of color. I keep seeing COACHE surveys that say the same things (BIPOC faculty and staff do not have good experiences on campus, etc.), but no changes are implemented. There are also problems with the COACHE survey (and other surveys) that make it nearly impossible to gather complete information about the experiences of BIPOC faculty and staff. The university could further do more to make the student body representative. For example, there are far fewer Black students than there are Black people in [state].</span></li>
          
            <li><span class="comments">We have a 70 to 1 student to faculty ratio in our department.  This CANNOT be fixed in any significant way at this point by hiring more faculty, nor will we decrease the number of students (it is actually increasing). They only way to deal with the situation that senior administration has allowed to happen is to get the resources we need to teach that many students.  Our department has more students (4200 undergrads) than some UNIVERSITIES. But we have 6 staff members. Six.  In a class of 250 students we get 2 TAs because the allotment of TA waivers from the [graduate college] to the departments is anemic.  At my previous institution I had 20+ undergrad TAs AND 2 PhD TAs for a class of that size.  We simply teach too many sections of too many students for that pitiful support to make a dent. Students are not getting the personal attention they need to succeed and then it is the faculty&#39;s fault that they are not graduating in high enough percentages after 4 or 5 years.  I wonder why.  We have a ridiculous Administrator and Staff to Faculty ratio (universities should be required to report this).  I could hire all the teach support the department needs for a year at the cost of 1 of our meaningless associate vice president provost senior mumblefrat no one knows what positions in the university or maybe a couple of people from the general counsel&#39;s office.  Enrollment was mismanaged and has spiraled out of control, completely beyond the capability of any one person to dial it back.  Resources have not tracked commensurately (understatement of the year). &#34;Be more creative&#34;.  Come up with novel solutions as faculty to make the current untenable situations we&#39;ve placed you in survivable.  So we have adapted.  We have persisted.  But we are not winning.  It is a losing battle and we are losing our best people to  other places where there is still hope.  Unless a massive---truly MASSIVE shift of resources (and I mean dollars, cold hard cash) is made toward investment in faculty hiring and TA/[undergraduate learning assistant] resources the problem will never be solved.  The best faculty who want to remain loyal will slave away, overworked and underpaid, trying their best to &#34;be creative&#34; and come up with innovative solutions to these administration-created problems, with no acknowledgment of error or even a &#34;we get it and we&#39;re trying to help you&#34; from the administration, but eventually even the strongest will crack and finally crumble.  Leave or retire.  Succumb to the inevitable while the administration&#39;s response will simply be &#34;Charge on.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">We need to define an institutional identity: The university relatively recently and rather tenuously qualified to lay claim to being R1, yet it still operates much like a very large community college in style and substance (e.g. a R1 university that does not have 24-hour library access?) What are we, really? What does the university feasibly aspire to be?  In this vein, [institution] needs an integrating vision to align more effectively its many disparate and often duplicating efforts. The silo effect besets modern universities across the globe, yes -- largely due to hyper-specialization in the modern academy -- but I have never elsewhere witnessed so many little pockets and enclaves and silos that simply do not speak to each other, even when they have goals in common or overlapping interests.</span></li>
