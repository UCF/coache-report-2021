      <p class=""><span>The final question in the COACHE survey asks faculty to describe the one thing your institution can do to improve the workplace for faculty. COACHE analysts assigned all responses to one or more common themes. The following are responses found to be related to this theme.</span>
      </p>
    </div><!-- end .head -->

    <div class="body">
      <div class="list">
        <ul>

            <li><span class="comments">Improving equity between titles and compensation between non-TT and TT positions. Far too often, lecturers with terminal degrees are hired who take on [class number] loads and do as much or more research as TT faculty but they are compensated much less. Titles for these positions could be improved to improve equity and standing at the University among faculty (e.g. Asst. Professor of Practice rather than Lecturer as a title).</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Deepen opportunities for faculty to research, and produce maximally. Create greater diversity, both in ideas and in campus presence of other populations. Build a greater basis for collegial life; this university is very alienating, and sometimes feels impersonal, because faculty have very scant opportunities to meet, interact, socialize, examine each other&#39;s work, and generally live a collegial life! The University often tends to think of faculty, it seems, as workers and contractors, not as a Deanry of scholars, engaged in high research in a community of knowledge. This in my mind, affects the relationship between work, and the essence of the work done in the university. The university has to offer in sum, an equal acknowledgement of faculty doing work whether in the Humanities or in Science, or in Engineering, or the Social Sciences; and stop creating an academic apartheid of privileges that tend to segregate accomplishments and create dissatisfaction!</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">My department&#39;s culture is one of gossip behind closed doors, a small cabal influencing the chair and everyone else being ignored, and general hostility among faculty that no one will even admit. It&#39;s hard to articulate how the institution as a whole could change this, but the &#34;it&#39;s only the individuals&#34; explanations don&#39;t help either. The fact is, the institution sets out constant competition as the ideal, and this makes it hard for sub-units to do anything else. The university always puts programs into place that superficially seem to provide resources and change, but that aren&#39;t substantive and do not really effect any change. They just require us to receive more email spam and bureaucratic requirements when what we actually need is to cut administrative offices and use that funding to provide lighter teaching loads, regular sabbaticals, and other kinds of day-to-day support for faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Conduct meaningful post-tenure reviews to hold tenured faculty accountable for continuing to engage in research activities. We have way too many (ridiculously high paid!) duds around here. Also, since they have so much free time due to having no research agenda, they spend all that time thinking up ways to make other people miserable.  We have no recourse because it&#39;s not race or gender discrimination. Apparently, as long as you are horrid to EVERYONE rather than just to specific groups, you get a free pass. The university needs post-tenure accountability mechanisms.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Someone has to do something about the devastating effect of teaching in a pandemic to our research. [Home university] was NEVER very good about research in the humanities BUT now, it&#39;s terrible.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Pre-pandemic: refining job descriptions, work allocations, policy/procedures to guide decision making Pandemic world: I feel [home university] is doing the best it can!!</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Recruit high quality students.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The overall communication and structure with so many changes of leadership and combining our College to be so large and combined with so many parts and moving pieces and locations I call it the land of misfit toys.  Working in the College is not pleasant with colleagues who have joined from somewhat toxic departments or who do not understand each other making it hard to enjoy the overall culture of a University with so many changes and not settling in really any area from department, college, and university.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">There are some faculty members shouldering tremendous service loads that are not compensated for in any way, especially when those faculty members are non tenure earning. The discrepancy between faculty there can be tremendous. Faculty who carry substantially larger service workloads should be compensated with course release.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">[Institution] tends to push the ideology that bigger is better and they emphasize throughput over quality. This, coupled with an aggressive pursuit to get to the top without the resources necessary to support faculty has created a cut-throat, stressful, and toxic environment that disproportionally and negatively impacts women and minorities.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reconfigure the [Interdisciplinary College]. The creation of this college destroyed the work of the College of [Field].</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reduced teaching load and class size.  The leadership at this institution states that they are aiming for R1 status.  But it is unreasonable to expect faculty to perform R1 level research with an R2-R3 teaching load.  While our department provides an attractive package for new faculty, existing faculty have a relatively high teaching load and there is little to no GTA support.  Funding expectations are extremely high in spite of the high teaching load.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Pay people. Pay adjuncts a fee that is not insulting. Teaching a 3 credit hour class is worth way more than [amount].  Not to mention we now expect adjuncts to teach online and they have to go through mandatory training that they don&#39;t get paid for!  Pay faculty members, especially new faculty members, a respectable wage. New faculty in my department are offered [amount] with no negotiation allowed--take it or leave it.  How are we supposed to attract the highest quality faculty with that?  I&#39;ve been here more than [number] years and that is only [amount] more than my starting salary.  Seriously, [amount] increase in starting pay in more than [number] years?!?! It is lip service to say we are trying to attract the best faculty. Paying a reasonable salary and recruiting high quality faculty would have a significant positive impact on my workplace.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Equitable salaries, especially for faculty who have been at [institution] for a longer time - the issues of salary compression and salary inversion are real and they lead to animosity and competition in the work environment. The second issue is the top-down model of decision making, especially among people like [redacted] who create discriminatory policies with no research or justification. Rather than address faculty who might be problematic, we have a sweeping policy created that discriminates against married people in an institution that tries to portray itself as family-friendly by having marital hiring opportunities.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Continue the focus on improvement.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Leadership needs to better understand what everyone below does and the immense pressure that faculty and department leaders are under. Leadership just keeps rolling down request after request and there aren&#39;t enough hours in a day to complete those. No life-work balance. Also don&#39;t wait decades to recognize some of your leadership potential in existing faculty. And please stop the bullying that goes on towards faculty and towards department leaders--it&#39;s reached ridiculous levels and little support is offered.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Excellence in everything from the tiniest detail to the largest. Being a large entity is no excuse to tolerate incompetence in anything, which happens way too much at [home institution].</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">we have corrupt leadership who has conflict of interest on the departmental level with self-promotion, self dealing, hiring without doing a true search or looking for diversity, nepotism and lack of transparency. There is a cabal of full professors who pursue career growth and titles and leave all the rest of the people to do the teaching and drudgery work and have monopolized all resources that would allow hiring of adjuncts etc.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Consistent salary increases to match changes in cost of living and the elimination of competitive awards that put faculty against one another</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">It should be noted that my responses to your survey are based on two major considerations.  First, our department has had an [administrator] for over [number] years (a tenured faculty member/full professor who has worked in the department for [number]+ years). Under this person&#39;s leadership, esteemed researchers/faculty members have resigned/retired/left to go to other institutions because of this [administrator’s] authoritative leadership style - which has profoundly impacted the department (negatively) -- particularly faculty in leadership positions (program director positions, etc.).  There is no open communication &#34;permitted&#34; - this is one of many examples.  At any rate, this has resulted in a non-trusting large group of faculty with low morale, etc.  Further, a new Dean for the college was hired at the same time the [administrator] took over.  Faculty rarely hear from the Dean (twice that I can recall), and the [administrator] has made it clear that faculty are not &#34;permitted&#34; to reach out to the Dean (the [administrator] must be the one to do this).   Having said all of this, the University/Department (after two failed searches) successfully completed a search (recently) for the [administrator] position - and the new [administrator] is anticipated to start in early [month].  In consultation with other colleagues, it has been agreed that our department will need some time to &#34;heal&#34; from the past two years...we are hopeful that the new [administrator] will understand the situation.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Balance teaching load with research expectations among departmental faculty of all ranks.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The Interim Director of our department has destroyed it.  There is now  a culture of disrespect and apathy and punishment.  The Dean of [division] is largely absent in terms of any presence with us - we never see [her/him], speak with [her/him], interact with [her/him].  Very different than previous Deans; [her/him] opinions of the [division] have to be based on what is told to him by the Interim Director/not a good thing.   Interaction I&#39;ve had with him (limited) has been uncomfortable and off-putting.  Thankfully, we have a new Director finally hired to end this [number] year reign of abuse.  [Institution] could have helped us more; we asked for help and got none.  The culture now is that it doesn&#39;t matter if you try to do a good job or not; it just doesn&#39;t matter.  Hard for those of us who take pride in our work to live under these circumstances.  [Institution] should help faculty who reach out for help with their workplace problems; not act like they are trying to help but there is no positive outcome or communication.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I feel that our department is not reaching it&#39;s full potential by undercutting the quality of student work, focusing on community art over museum quality work, and not providing enough research time/offices to non-tenure track earning faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I don&#39;t feel supported when I report bad behavior by faculty.  As a [administrative role], I hear numerous stories about faculty behaving badly.  These reports come from undergraduate students, graduate students, and colleagues.  I send these reports upward, but nothing ever happens.  I have [number] faculty in my department who regularly abuse students (not physically), I have reported each of them at least 4=5 times, and nothing has ever happened to them.  As [administrative role], that makes me look like I&#39;m not doing anything about these reports.  I feel like the only faculty who experience repercussions for their behavior are faculty who are REALLY offensive (and probably make the news). This makes it extremely hard to be a [administrative role].</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I&#39;d like my institution leaders to value faculty who are not tenured but that are reliable, present, enthusiastic about their work and dedicated to their craft. Maybe one is not getting a top dollar grant or an outstanding award, but what they do on a daily basis for their students should be also recognized as valuable. Since COVID hit, for instance, when most faculty chose not to be back to the classrooms, faculty who did so were barely acknowledged, despite being a mere handful out of dozens. There was almost no recognition of the fact that these faculty members prioritized their many students who were vocal about wanting to be on campus and braved a full semester of face to face classes with responsibility and utmost care, and ended their semester dutifully and without any issues or hazard to themselves of their students.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">The university focuses touch of its energy in non essential activities or fads. Just focus in good teaching amd good research.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reduce teaching load to encourage more scholarly activities. Reduce class sizes for more effective teaching and engagement.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">more direct meetings/communication with individuals annually especially with regard to the individual within the academic community and our institution. it may not be able to be helped that our location is remote and that this creates the feelings, somewhat, of separation//isolation.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">1) Do not reward toxic, under performing tenured colleagues who make every one else&#39;s life miserable.  2) Increase salary  3) Fund Graduate students completely.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Focus on Educating Students and on Quality Instruction, not on being the largest (number-wise) university in the US. Even though it has been said that we aren&#39;t trying to be the biggest, that doesn&#39;t translate when looking at the class size of many courses. When there are more than 25/30 students in a class, an instructor cannot give the feedback and attention students need.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I would like to see [institution] make more effort to retain female faculty. We have lost a number of excellent female faculty members due to a variety of reasons: sexual harassment, undervaluing/underpaying female faculty, a lack of equity between male and female faculty, and it is harder for female faculty to be promoted at [institution].</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Recognize the role of instructor as the backbone of the teaching duties at the university and taking advantage of the instructor&#39;s strength. Not giving recognition with awards for less effective teaching to people who are on a tenure track so that it &#34;looks good&#34;. Not giving substandards faculty teaching opportunities just because they have PhD and taking them away from a more qualified instructor.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Equity - currently a real lack of equity in pay, workload, expectations, class sizes, tenure requirements, etc. between colleges and even departments.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I really feel burned out by the amount of service I have.  it does not seem like other faculty have half as much.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I would very much like to see additional resources and attention devoted to research and scholarship. In my department for the last five years or so, there has been no focus on research, recognizing research, supporting research. It&#39;s just so strange to have research and scholarship be such a vital and generative part of my professional life, but have it be so absent from any discussion or action in my department. From what I gather, my department is mostly focused on getting faculty involved in and supporting their efforts toward various kinds of departmental service. Over the past five years in my department, tenure-line and tenured faculty have never once had an opportunity to come together to talk about the status and value of research/scholarship in the department, or to talk with the department chair about how to support that work.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Compensation must be tied to merit and performance.  I have never earned less than an Outstanding rating on my annual evaluations in [number] years on the faculty at [institution], yet always receive the exact same tiny across the board raise or a few hundred dollars of “bonus” that people who are far less accomplished receive.    After a decade of this I no longer feel compelled to excel.  Why should I not just tread water like the others if I am not going to be recognized or rewarded for my consistently “outstanding” level of performance?  Why do we even HAVE annual evaluations if they are not tied to compensation?  I assure you that my high performing colleagues feel identically, because we talk about it every time “raises” are announced. [Institution] has alienated its top performers by giving them the same participation trophy that those who aren’t as effective (or in some cases outright incompetent) receive.  This is incredibly shortsighted and has begun to cause a measurable decline in faculty output.  There simply is no motivation to excel, so why bother?    While the faculty “union” is largely responsible for this socialist nonsense, the administration is only too willing to agree because it saves them money.  Those of us who are consistently outstanding are easing back on the extra effort because there is no discernible benefit to strive for excellence.    The result from this, as with all socialist policies, is ubiquitous mediocrity.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I think that [institution] would best be improved by hiring more (quality) tenure track professors. Growing the faculty will increase the research output of the university which will increase national and international recognition of  [institution]. This will increase grant funding at  [institution], help us recruit better graduate students, and reduce teaching loads both to improve the faculty&#39;s work life and the quality of our undergraduate and graduate education.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">We need more professors of color in our departments and we need more PhD professors in the [School]. I would like to see the research profile of [the school] raised.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Improvement is needed in equity of work-load across faculty. There is a strong bias to overload people who have high work-ethic, quality of work to receive more work than those who do not perform as well. There is also a bias toward tenured faculty as untouchable, regardless of ethical behavior.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">more equitable teaching loads across departments and colleges and lower student to faculty ratio</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">To better evaluate the people they put in leadership positions to ensure that they are in fact effective leaders and prevent any one person from having too much negative impact on individuals or a department, need to hear faculty voices and department voices and actually make a concerted effort to make progress. For one individual to create so many challenges and issues with an entire department is unacceptable.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Diversity and Inclusion. More Deans and Departments Chairs: HISPANIC.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">find ways to address subpar performance by tenured faculty</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Focus on the goal of educating the public.  That goal has been largely displaced by a preoccupation with diversity and inclusivity initiatives.  Simultaneously, our undergraduate class sizes are vastly larger than they should be.  [Institution] is a diploma mill.  Academic standards are routinely compromised in the name of diversity, inclusivity, and inattention by course instructors.  This trend ultimately undermines the central role played by institutions of higher learning for the past millennia.  I implore you - reallocate resources from D&amp;I to student training in methods of rationality, improvement of laboratory science training for students from all disciplines, writing-intensive coursework, and reduction of class sizes.  Grade inflation further undermines the legitimacy of our work and must be addressed.  Maybe, just maybe, if we are genuinely concerned with equitable treatment of persons and equity in undergraduate enrollment, we may devote some attention to addressing the most substantive disparity on campus - the shortage of men in college classrooms.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">There needs to be fewer fiefdoms. I have said this over and over. Yet nothing is done. Follow published standards across the board without exception.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">In the [division], I think we need to work on our national reputation. We need to encourage our students to expand their horizons. Our students have a very local mindset. They only think about working for [local healthcare providers] or their hometown hospitals when they graduate. We have exceptional students here, and I&#39;ve been encouraging them to consider positions at top tier hospitals out of state. It&#39;s great for their careers to learn in these top tier institutions and sets them up for success. It&#39;s also good advertising for our college and university. I suspect students that go on to be successful are more likely to donate back to the college, so their success ultimately benefits us. For a lot of reasons, I think we need to encourage our students to have a more global mindset. I also think we need higher standards for admission in our graduate program. It seems like we&#39;re accepting everyone, and it shows in the quality of the student and graduate. In the PhD program, we need more emphasis on research fit of potential candidates.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">I often marked &#34;teaching load,&#34; but I would&#39;ve selected &#34;class size&#34; if it had been an option. Class size at [institution] is out of control, and the #1 contributing cause to my own constant stress and dissatisfaction with my job.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Provide administrative accountability. I trust no support member to actually do their job. It is exhausting, and makes me dislike my job.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Graduate students are the foundation of a research university. Our administration -- from the [institution] Office of Student Financial Assistance, up to and including the President of [institution], have demonstrated an unsettling lack of understanding as to the role of graduate students -- who they are, what they do, and how they contribute to our university&#39;s mission. [Institution] has lofty ambitions of expanding its international recognition and prominence as an R1 research institution, and yet our base graduate stipends are several thousand dollars below the estimated poverty line for the [regional] area. Particularly worrisome is the treatment (and at times, outright disrespect) towards our graduate students of color -- not necessarily at the individual level, but at the institutional level. For example, the Office of Student Financial Assistance routinely fails to distribute external funding to our graduate students in a timely manner. In one particularly egregious incident, I understand that a PhD student of color was instructed to take out personal loans to make ends meet until his external fellowship -- which was awarded to promote diverse representation in STEM -- came through. In fact the funds had already been transferred to [institution], and there was no legitimate excuse for the delay. Nevertheless, the student was told that nothing could be done, and the student became visibly upset (and justifiably so). In response, rather than attempting to look into the issue to help the student, this graduate student of color was threatened with removal by security. A few hours later, a white male colleague in my department made a phone call to a white male administrator, and the funds were released to the student on the very same day. I share this anecdote because this shameful incident is a consistent pattern with [institution] -- performative dialogue regarding both 1) research excellence and 2) diversity and inclusion, while our very own students too often fall between the cracks. I also share this because I know we can do better. I am happy to acknowledge [institution]&#39;s attempts at progress over the last year, but there is a very long way to go before [institution] is truly an inclusive environment. Expanding resources for graduate students -- most importantly, raising the base stipend to *at least* a living wage -- would be substantially more effective at improving our recruitment/retention abilities for both graduate students and faculty, and would simultaneously make [institution] a more hospitable environment for our students of color. To conclude, it is my view that the single greatest threat to [institution]&#39;s continued success is its lack of investment in graduate students. While it is certainly not too late to address the issue, we are moving too slowly, and risk being left in the dust by our peer institutions.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">To improve the quality of research, we need to have more focused and collegial group and environment. We are currently lack of a definite development training and system for research junior faculty development. They are facing multiple challenges in particular after Covid-19 pandemic.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Don&#39;t leave faculty positions unfilled when someone leaves or retires. When that happens, the load falls on those of us who are here. And it&#39;s getting to be crushing. And patching it with adjuncts doesn&#39;t work because we have to take time to train and manage the adjuncts. Thank you.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">We have a wonderful program, unique nationally, and accomplishing much more than others with much larger budgets.  However, a previous administration changed the policy on awards (Pegasus, etc.) and grants that provided a good portion of our operating budget, imperiling our activities.  We are hoping this situation gets rectified and our value to the university is appreciated.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">For the last two hiring cycles, our department has had some difficulty attracting good pool of applicants, and then enticing our preferred candidates to accept the job offer. I suspect this has something to do with the resources (e.g. salary compensation, leave) we offer incoming assistant professors. We offer no pre-tenure leave or course releases, and any post-tenure leave requires an application. The salary we offer incoming assistant professors--while higher than a few years ago--is still among the lowest of any R1 university in our field, especially when considering the cost of living in [city]. So the best thing [institution] could do for us would be to allow us to make more attractive job offers to job candidates.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Stop making everything a competition; for pay raises, sabbaticals, ....</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">With a new president, my hope is high that [he/she] may bring a new vision (quality over quantity) and transparency to decision-making processes.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Deal effectively with arrogant, non-performing tenured faculty.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Reduce teaching load and class sizes. We teach very large classes in my department, and the quality of our courses has suffered as a result. Faculty are stretched too thin to do top-quality work with all of the classes and students they teach. A number of my colleagues also seem overwhelmed with their workloads and have only avoided burn-out by slacking off with their teaching obligations.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Mentor some faculty to be fair to students and respect others</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Limit the growth of the undergraduate student population with the goal of increasing the intellectual &#39;quality&#39; of the mean student admitted.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Overhaul the Enrollment Management - change the way we serve as an access institution substantially so that we can in fact mature as a research university</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">This institution is absolutely a traditional &#34;publish or perish&#34; environment that has not considered the changing academic and world environment around research, student engagement, and value of publications over the sheer number of them and in what journals.  This is a huge dissatisfier as the focus is not on student engagement and achievement although that it what is exported externally.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Recruitment of graduate students. I am in an emerging field and the institution is trying to establish the presence of the field at the institution. However, advertising the presence of the field at the institution is almost none-existent, and therefore competing for graduate students and promoting it to potential graduate students is limited. This means that the teaching, research and institutional understanding of the field is proving difficult to promote and legitimize.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">By focusing on &#34;scale&#34; we have lost the ability to selectively chose the best graduate students from around the world and thus, we have lost the ability to positively IMPACT research. [Institution] hires graduate students indiscriminately and thus, our STEM research programs suffer. The entire pipeline (from marketing to recruiting to training to placement) of STEM graduates is broken and unless this is fixed, we will suffer from mediocrity. This needs to change at the University and College levels.   Part of this problem is tied to an existing perception problem with [institution] (when compared to [peer institution] and other [region] Universities such as [peer institution 2]). Part of this problem is also tied to the pervasive culture of mediocrity and low expectations from our UGs; many of whom end up working at retail stores after earning a Bachelors in  Engineering/Sciences.   In the pursuit of &#34;Scale&#34; we have lost our ability set standards and clear expectations from our students.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Do a better job of balancing quality versus quantity especially with regard to class sizes.</span></li>

            <li><span class="comments">Take away [guarantee transfer system from partner institutions]; decrease the quantity and increase the quality of transfer students.</span></li>
